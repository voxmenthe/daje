                 We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said in an interview Sunday he hates the concept of profiling, but at the same time is open to increasing profiling of American Muslims.In a discussion that mentioned the surveillance of American mosques and response to recent terrorist attacks, Face the Nation host John Dickerson asked Trump if he was open to having law enforcement officials single out Muslims in America.I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country, Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. Trump said it’s a concept that must be looked at seriously. He mentioned Israel and others as countries that successfully profile.We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, he said. And other countries do it. And it’s not the worst thing to do. I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to use common sense. we’re not using common sense.Dickerson also asked Trump if Muslims should receive extra scrutiny when buying ammunition and weapons.I don’t know about that, Trump said.

I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, Wayne LaPierre said of Donald Trumps suggestion that there couldve been guns at Pulse nightclub to stop the shooter.  GettyEfforts by Democrats to introduce new gun control legislation amount to little more than a smoke screen intended to shift attention away from failed policy to combat terrorism, National Rifle Association Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said Sunday.What happened this past week is the president, the whole gun ban movement said look over here, divert your attention, take your eyes off the problem, LaPierre told John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation.They don’t want to face the embarrassment of their failure in this terrorist area, and they want to cover their butts and not talk about it.LaPierre pointed to a measure introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that would notify law enforcement should a suspected terrorist attempt to buy a weapon as an acceptable compromise, but noted concerns voiced by FBI Director James Comey that stopping a terrorist from purchasing a weapon could actually alert that terrorist that he or she is under investigation. We need to look at all our vulnerabilities and we need to harden, because they’re coming and they’re going to try to kill us and we need to be prepared, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.The NRA CEO said as far as he knew, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in broad agreement with the association’s stance.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said, arguing that terrorists in California and Paris used firearms to kills dozens of people in places with strict gun laws. He called for armed security in vulnerable targets like malls, churches and schools but stopped short of suggesting that people in bars and nightclubs, like the one where 49 people were shot in Orlando, should be carrying guns.I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, he told Dickerson.Later, the NRA attempted to clarify LaPierres remarks in a post to Twitter. Its fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar that serves alcohol, the NRA wrote on LaPierres behalf, but not if you plan to drink.

Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Fareed Zakaria: Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States?  AP PhotoRussian leader Vladimir Putin said he didnt praise presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump quite effusively as has been reported.Speaking to Fareed Zakaria during a panel discussion in St. Petersburg, Putin responded Friday to a question about his praise for Trump by saying: I only said that he was a bright person. Isn’t he bright? He is.Why do you always change the meaning of what I said? Putin asked in response to Zakarias question about Putin calling Trump brilliant.Zakaria acknowledged the word brilliant may have been a matter of imprecise translation. Putin had made the statement in December, drawing praise in return from Trump for his leadership ability.In the latest discussion, which aired Sunday on CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS, Putin did voice his approval of Trumps willingness to restore full-fledged Russian-American relations, but declined to offer additional support for Trump or anything much in the way of opinions about presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.We never interfere into the internal political processes of other countries, Putin said in his typically expressionless manner.The Russian president did take a slap at American self-righteousness toward other countries when it comes to adherence to democratic processes.Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States? Putin asked Zakaria, adding: Twice in American history, a president was elected who did not get the majority of votes.Putin, presumably, was referring to the elections of 1876 (Rutherford Hayes) and 2000 (George W. Bush) when the candidate who received the most votes did not win in the Electoral College.Putin did acknowledge Americas status in the world: The U.S. is a great power. At the moment, it is probably the only superpower and we accept this fact.The Russian leader said he didnt think the world was sliding toward a new Cold War but did take some digs, direct and indirect, at international sanctions and NATO, which he said needed an external enemy to justify its continued existence.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan took part in the panel discussion, which also focused on topics ranging from Ukraine to Russian athletic doping scandals.

Sen. Ron Johnson on the GOP situation: I think things remain reasonably uncertain.  APLocked in a tough fight for reelection this November, Sen. Ron Johnson said Sunday he plans to support Donald Trump for president but didnt formally endorse the presumptive nominee.There’s a big difference between the two, the Wisconsin senator explained on CNN’s State of the Union after saying he intends to support the Republican nominee.Well to me, he told Dana Bash, endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything, Johnson said. Thats not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I’ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. Ill voice it, whether its Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else.Trump’s controversial candidacy could spell trouble for Johnson this fall, who faces a stiff challenge from former Sen. Russ Feingold, whom Johnson ousted in 2010. A recent Marquette University Law School poll shows Johnson trailing Feingold, 51 percent to 42 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters.Johnson was not willing to dismiss the notion that Trump’s nomination might come undone at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland even though Trump would seem to have more than enough delegates. He said that while he’s not a part of any movement to deny Trump the GOP nomination, nobody can really predict whats going to be the outcome of our nomination process.He also made that point about unpredictability in discussing his support for Trump: It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee.

Some, including Mitt Romney and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have been loudly critical of their party’s nominee.But Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press that he can win in November, with or without their support.Were going to have a great convention and I think were going to go on to a great victory.

Characterizing it as a creation of the media, Trump scoffed at the notion that his pile of delegates could be snatched out from underneath him on the convention floor by a candidate who would like to come in through the back door.So I win 38 states and somebody else won none and they’re going to be the nominee?

I don’t even want that kind of money, Trump said, borrowing a line of attack that Sen. Bernie Sanders used regularly against Clinton during the Democratic primary.

He was a bad dude. I mean, look, will somebody slip through? I guess, Trump told ABC’s This Week in an interview with Jonathan Karl. I guess the gun store owner reported him and the authorities didn’t act on it. What a shame.What does that say to you? Karl followed up.To me, it says very sad. They reported him and the authorities didn’t act, Trump replied. I think it’s very unusual. I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Florida, said Thursday that an unidentified person had come to his store several weeks back and tried to buy body armor, which Abells employees said they did not have. The would-be buyer left the store, and Abell said he reported the individual to the FBI as suspicious. The person, Abell realized after the shooting, was Mateen.In his interview with Karl, taped backstage at one of Trump’s rallies this weekend in Texas, the Republican candidate renewed his promise to talk to the National Rifle Association about banning suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. The presumptive nominee wouldn’t say whether he could budge the NRA on the issue, only that he wanted to find out their thinking.What I want, and I know what they want, they want it as much as anybody in the world, they want to make sure that terrorists don’t get guns, Trump said.

Jeff Sessions said Sunday that somehow, some way, we should be able to make this work.Like many other Republicans, Sessions (R-Ala.) expressed concern that legislation banning suspected terrorists from purchasing guns might infringe on the constitutional rights of those wrongly entered onto terrorism watch lists.He told CNN’s State of the Union that he would be willing to listen to a compromise proposal being crafted by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), praising her diligence and expertise on the various terrorism watch lists and the respective thresholds for inclusion on each one.But a lot of people may be wrongly on the list. In fact, I’m sure there are a lot of people on that list that shouldn’t be on it, Sessions said, without specifying which of the various terrorism watch lists he was speaking of. So if youre going to deny a person a Constitutional right like free speech or the right to have a firearm, then that person has to have an opportunity to explain that they shouldnt be on the list. … Thats what the difference is. Republicans have voted consistently to ban people on that list from having a gun, but to give them an opportunity to prove they shouldnt be on the list. Sessions, one of the most prominent supporters of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, defended the presumptive Republican nominee’s renewed call to temporarily ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Sessions explained that his understanding of Trump’s proposal is that the ban would target nations with a history of terrorist activity and would not prohibit diplomats and business travelers from moving between those nations and the U.S. The senator referred to the proposal as a tightening of immigration policy and named Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as countries that might fall under Trump’s proposal.Sessions also attacked what he called the talking heads in the Republican Party who have steadfastly refused to fall in line behind Trump as the party’s nominee, encouraging them to read Trump’s great speech on immigration and foreign policy last week. He contrasted Trump’s remarks with those of President Barack Obama, whose response has been unbelievably weak.Finally, Sessions said he was not in discussions with the Trump campaign about the possibility of becoming the candidate’s running mate but did reiterate that he’d consider joining the ticket if asked.I only said if I were asked I would consider it. I dont expect that to happen, Sessions said. I have no idea what theyre doing. I suspect people are thinking about it, but it will be an important decision. He needs somebody who can be a great president if something happens to him, somebody who can help him advance an agenda that I think is the American peoples agenda.

I think what’s important is to continue to keep our focus on the victims of this tragic crime as well, Lynch said Sunday on ABCs This Week. One of the things Ill do in Orlando on Tuesday is meeting with victims, talking about the support well be providing them as well.

Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win. Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.

Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge. Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued.

On this day in 1856, the first national convention of the Republican Party ended in Philadelphia’s Music Fund Hall. The delegates nominated as their presidential candidate John Frémont of California, who had gained widespread fame as a Western explorer, with William Dayton of New Jersey as his running mate.Frémont ran on the slogan Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Frémont and Victory! In an election in which nearly 80 percent of eligible U.S. voters cast their ballots, Frémont carried all of New England, plus New York, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin, amassing 114 electoral votes.But he was unable to carry California, which he had briefly represented as a senator after it became a state in 1850.In its platform, the party, founded only two years earlier, called on Congress to bar slavery and bigamy. Not surprisingly, the Georgia-born Frémont fared poorly in the South. Ignoring the slavery issue, the American Party, or Know-Nothings, captured nearly a quarter of the popular vote by running former President Millard Fillmore on an anti-immigration, anti-Catholic platform. James Buchanan, the Democratic nominee, won with 174 electoral votes. A shift of only a small number of votes in several states would have tipped the electoral tally to the Republicans. During the campaign, Frémont decried the expansion of slavery while Buchanan warned that the Republicans were extremists whose victory would lead to civil war. The Democrats endorsed popular sovereignty as the best method to determine slavery’s legality for newly admitted states.Four years later, most Southern states threatened to leave the Union in the event of a Republican victory. On Nov. 6, 1860, Republican Abraham Lincoln defeated the divided Democrats. Six weeks later, South Carolina seceded, with five more Southern states soon following in its wake.On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began when Confederate shore batteries under Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter in South Carolina’s Charleston Bay. The ensuing Confederate defeat entrenched the Republicans as the nation’s prevailing party. Although by 1876 the GOP had lost control of the re-segregated South, the party continued to dominate the presidency, with a few interruptions, until Franklin D. Roosevelt’s victory in 1932.SOURCE: THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, 1854-1966, BY GEORGE MAYER (1967) On this day in 1856, the first national convention of the Republican Party ended in Philadelphia’s Music Fund Hall.

Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together. Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team. But it took a perfect storm for Edwards to triumph in 2015, and there doesn’t appear to be a GOP candidate in the race with Vitter’s personal, party label-defying vulnerabilities.Visit the Campaign Pro Race Dashboard to track the candidates and consulting firms engaged in the top House, Senate, and gubernatorial races of 2016.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney. Woodbury, who has been a delegate to the last six national conventions, won’t be a delegate in Cleveland.Trump’s fraught relationship with the LDS community starts at the top: Romney has been one of the GOP’s most persistent and vocal critics of the nominee. During the GOP primary, Trump questioned the sincerity of Romney’s faith and consistently lost parts of the country with heavy Mormon populations — like eastern Idaho and Utah.Recent general election polls out of heavily Mormon, deep-red Utah have newly underscored Trump’s broader challenge with the community—a community that is troubled by, among other things, his hostile language toward Hispanic immigrants (many Mormons do missions to South America) and his waffling on social issues. The LDS church, which itself suffered much discrimination in the past, released a statement in December saying, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns. However, it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom. The statement came as Trump pushed a proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration. According to the recent most recent Utah poll, Trump is deadlocked with Hillary Clinton in Utah — in a state that hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1964.I cannot go there, said Heidi Wixom, a Nevada Mormon and GOP activist well-respected in the community, of voting for Trump. Pointing to the list of incendiary comments he has made about other minority groups, she continued, Belonging to a church that has felt persecution, you wonder, will his rhetoric continue on? What happens to a group of people he sees aren’t supportive of him? What would he do to them?Trump’s Mormon issue may be felt acutely in a swing state like Nevada. Despite twice voting for Barack Obama, it’s still considered a November battleground. Trump ran well there in the Nevada caucuses but he’ll need an energized base to push him over the finish line. Enthusiastic LDS backing alone won’t be enough to win the state—as Romney demonstrated—but the chilly reception Trump is receiving from top community leaders could help ensure that Nevada stays blue.Wixom said that she spoke with around 40 fellow LDS Republicans in Nevada on Thursday. Five were enthusiastic Trump supporters, seven said they could never back him, and the rest, she said, were holding their noses and preparing to vote for him—but won’t do any organizing for him.Nevada LDS people are not going to say ‘support,’ they’re going to say ‘vote,’ she said. They’re not supporting at large. They’re tolerating and voting. They’re not going to be putting Trump signs in the yards, they’re not going to be rallying around phone calls, they’re not going to help with grassroots efforts.But it’s still early, stressed Ira Hansen, a Mormon Republican assemblyman and the assistant majority floor leader, adding that he expects the community to eventually embrace Trump—at least enough to help him over the finish line. That’s what Hansen did after his favored candidate, Ted Cruz, dropped out.I think we’ll find, when push comes to shove, his platform comes out, a lot of people will rally around, in the LDS community and elsewhere, Hansen said, noting that a solid vice presidential pick and more details on Supreme Court choices could further smooth that path.He went on to add, It’s way premature to start determining what people are going to start doing in August, September, October. The reality is, we haven’t had a convention, we don’t know who the picks are going to be as far as vice president, the Supreme Court, a lot of things that could make a dramatic turnaround.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment and questions about Trump’s Mormon outreach efforts.Plenty of Mormon leaders are adamant that even if Trump eventually gets their votes, he won’t get much of their time.I’m most likely to vote Trump, Christensen said. But I won’t be putting in the blood, sweat and tears like I have with Romney the last several cycles, with McCain. I don’t see a scenario where I do anything but vote for him. Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney.

On this day in 1957, the House, by a vote of 286-126, approved what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The legislative effort held the support of President Dwight Eisenhower as well as most congressional Republicans. Eisenhower signed the final draft into law on Sept. 9, 1957.The law marked the first significant measure to address civil rights since 1875. It established the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for two years, created a civil rights division in the U.S. Justice Department, and authorized the U.S. attorney general to seek federal court injunctions to protect the voting rights of all Americans..This is an hour for great moral stamina, Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., (D-N.Y.) one of three black members then serving in Congress, said on the House floor. America stands on trial today before the world and communism must succeed if democracy fails, he added.Sen. Lyndon Johnson (D-Texas), the majority leader, steered the bill through the Senate. Sen. Richard Russell (D-Ga.) claimed the bill sought to impose the will of the federal government on the states, disregarding the Constitution. The Senate voted to approve the bill after overcoming a filibuster by Sen. Strom Thurmond (D-S.C.), who set a Senate record for speaking 24 hours and 18 minutes. (Thurmond became a Republican in 1964.)The House approved the watered-down compromise measure on Aug. 27 by a vote of 279-97 and sent it to the White House.While the bill alienated Southern Democrats, they lifted their blockade after it became apparent that the measure would do little, if anything, to topple Jim Crow practices in the South. Thus, any person found guilty of obstructing someone’s right to register faced the prospect of a jury trial. In practical terms, that meant a guaranteed trial by an all-white jury — one unlikely to lead to a conviction.Black leaders were divided over the legislation. Ralph Bunche, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a future top U.N. diplomat, viewed the bill as a sham and said he would have preferred no act at all. However, Bayard Rustin of the Congress of Racial Equality said the act was important because of its symbolism: Heretofore, lawmakers had been unable to advance the cause of African-Americans for 82 years. Rustin, who went on to organize the biracial 1963 March on Washington, predicted that it would serve as a base for further action — as, indeed, it did with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.SOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HISTORIAN: HISTORY@MAIL.HOUSE.GOV;  On this day in 1957, the House, by a vote of 286-126, approved what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office.

AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.

The 2012 Republican National Convention is pictured.  GettyRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has selected a veteran Utah Republican leader to chair the rules committee at next month’s national convention — a crucial position that will oversee expected battles on whether delegates can be unbound to reject Donald Trump.In her first phone interview on the appointment, Enid Mickelsen, Utah’s Republican committeewoman, pledged to be fair to all members of the committee.My mindset is that we’re going to be fair, that people are going to be able to have an opportunity to make their proposals, debate their proposals or suggestions, she said. We are going to make this a fair and deliberative process. Nothing’s going to come out of this that’s been done by parliamentary trickery.The convention rules committee, a 112-member panel that consists of two delegates from every state and territory, is empowered to write the rules of the upcoming convention as well as set the framework of the GOP presidential nominating process that will take place in 2020.Mickelsen herself has proposed dramatically altering the calendar of GOP primaries to include a new batch of early states, though she told POLITICO she won’t introduce that proposal as chair, leaving it to others instead.The rules committee is likely to be the beginning of an effort by delegates opposed to Trump’s nomination to alter rules that would free delegates to choose someone else. Mickelsen said she was expecting spirited debate on those matters.There’s been a lot of speculation, there’s been a lot of discussion, but I’m confident in the end we’re going to make this a fair process, she said. Will it be lively? It probably will be at times.Mickelsen said she told Priebus months ago that she was open to chairing the rules committee if he wanted. She’s already the vice chair of the committee organizing the convention and as a result has been neutral in the presidential race so far — which she noted made her a good candidate for the rules post.She said she heard from Priebus with the official offer last night as she was walking into Game 6 of the NBA finals in Cleveland, the site of the convention.I was just walking into Game 6 when he called, he said.She noted that as of Friday morning, a crew was already working to set up the arena for the convention, which begins on July 18.At 8 a.m. this morning, they started unbolting chairs and moving equipment in, she said.

TWITTER SCREENGRABDonald Trump has spent the week stating his support for the LGBT community in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, remarking that he is a better ally than Hillary Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked for accepting donations from governments hostile to LGBT rights on behalf of the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists into our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone else who doesnt share their views or values, Trump said during a speech Monday, a day after 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub in Orlando.But a photo posted to Twitter on Thursday night showed the presumptive Republican nominee with someone decidedly opposed to LGBT rights.Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment, shared a photo in which he posed with Trump at the candidate’s rally at Gilleys, the citys famous honky-tonk.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonight’s Dallas rally, Jeffress tweeted, along with a photo in which they both held their thumbs up. Trump retweeted the image on Friday.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonights Dallas rally. #TrumpDallas c: @DanScavino pic.twitter.com/BcgWuszPnu— Dr. Robert Jeffress (@robertjeffress) June 17, 2016The First Baptist Church pastor in February 2015 was quoted as saying the gay rights movement will pave the way for that future world dictator, the Antichrist, to persecute and martyr Christians without any repercussions whatsoever.Jeffress last month celebrated his states leaders decision to refuse to comply with President Barack Obamas directive to create more accessibility for transgender students in public schools, saying it’s time for an all-out rebellion against this absolute tyranny of the Obama administration.It comes down to money, Todd, that’s what it’s about, Jeffress told Todd Starnes on Fox News Radio. And when states are being faced with the loss of business, they tend to fold real quickly. And I’ve said often that the greatest threat to freedom of religion in America is not ISIS, it’s the Chamber of Commerce. I mean, it’s the businesses that say to our representatives, ‘Oh, don’t pass laws like that, don’t pass these religious freedom laws because people will interpret that as anti-gay and we’ll lose business.’After the Supreme Court last summer ruled same-sex marriage legal, Jeffress said he believed our culture will get increasingly darker, adding that the decision was ultimately irrelevant.The Judge of all of the universe has already issued His decision: marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. And there is no appealing that verdict, he responded.                 Donald Trump poses with Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment.  TWITTER SCREENGRABDonald Trump has spent the week stating his support for the LGBT community in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, remarking that he is a better ally than Hillary Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked for accepting donations from governments hostile to LGBT rights on behalf of the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists into our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone else who doesnt share their views or values, Trump said during a speech Monday, a day after 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub in Orlando.But a photo posted to Twitter on Thursday night showed the presumptive Republican nominee with someone decidedly opposed to LGBT rights.Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment, shared a photo in which he posed with Trump at the candidate’s rally at Gilleys, the citys famous honky-tonk.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonight’s Dallas rally, Jeffress tweeted, along with a photo in which they both held their thumbs up. Trump retweeted the image on Friday.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonights Dallas rally. #TrumpDallas c: @DanScavino pic.twitter.com/BcgWuszPnu— Dr. Robert Jeffress (@robertjeffress) June 17, 2016The First Baptist Church pastor in February 2015 was quoted as saying the gay rights movement will pave the way for that future world dictator, the Antichrist, to persecute and martyr Christians without any repercussions whatsoever.Jeffress last month celebrated his states leaders decision to refuse to comply with President Barack Obamas directive to create more accessibility for transgender students in public schools, saying it’s time for an all-out rebellion against this absolute tyranny of the Obama administration.It comes down to money, Todd, that’s what it’s about, Jeffress told Todd Starnes on Fox News Radio. And when states are being faced with the loss of business, they tend to fold real quickly. And I’ve said often that the greatest threat to freedom of religion in America is not ISIS, it’s the Chamber of Commerce. I mean, it’s the businesses that say to our representatives, ‘Oh, don’t pass laws like that, don’t pass these religious freedom laws because people will interpret that as anti-gay and we’ll lose business.’After the Supreme Court last summer ruled same-sex marriage legal, Jeffress said he believed our culture will get increasingly darker, adding that the decision was ultimately irrelevant.The Judge of all of the universe has already issued His decision: marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. And there is no appealing that verdict, he responded. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way.

Elizabeth Warren visited Hillary Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn and spoke to staffers.  GettyMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a message for Hillary Clinton’s Brooklyn-based staff: Don’t screw this up.Less than a week after endorsing Clinton, Warren on Friday made a pit stop at Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters to rally the troops with an enthusiastic speech to staffers, including the succinct warning that they cant risk losing the election to Donald Trump.Warren spoke to Clinton staffers for about 15 minutes and then lingered to take selfies with the campaign operatives for about 20 minutes longer. One Clinton staffer noted that Warren attracted a crowd bigger than Jon Bon Jovi did when he recently stopped by the headquarters.The progressive standard bearer’s new involvement as a campaign surrogate comes after a meeting last week with Clinton at her Washington, D.C., home and amid growing speculation of whether she will be selected as Clinton’s pick for vice president.Warren is currently the most discussed potential vice presidential pick for Clinton. But sources close to both Warren and Clinton said there remains some ambivalence on both sides: Warren, one source said, would love the platform but remains hesitant to give up the independence that comes from her Senate seat. She respects Hillary enough to know that’s not how it would be, the source said. Clinton, meanwhile, is said to be in the process of vetting Warren, along with a long list of other potential picks, but does not have a historically warm relationship with the populist senator.Despite the intense scrutiny of the relationship between the two women, Warren traveled to New York for the meeting with no entourage or aides.She sat alone on the Acela from Washington, D.C., to New York, reading quietly and was seen chatting with Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, a longtime Clinton ally. Fellow train passengers stopped by to tell her, Atta girl, keep giving it to Trump!For now, both sides appear eager to keep the door and the speculation open for the joint ticket. In an interview with POLITICO last week, Clinton said Warren would be qualified for the No. 2 slot.I have the highest regard for Sen. Warren, she said. I think she is an incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role.                 Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited Hillary Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn and spoke to staffers.

Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J. Trump said that, As of December 31, 1993, DJT had a net operating loss (NOL) carry forward of approximately [redacted]. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains. Management has represented that DJT’s NOLs will be more than sufficient to satisfy all anticipated gains.In other words, Trump’s losses were large enough to prevent him from owing taxes.A similar report in 1993 came to the same conclusion about Trump’s tax obligations in 1991. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes. Indeed, Trump has bragged on the trail that he has leveraged business and tax laws to maximize profits for himself over the years. Nor is it a huge surprise that Trump would not owe significant taxes during the economic slowdown of the early 1990s as his companies teetered near bankruptcy.Still, it is notable that a man living on $450,000 per month — Trump also had a massive yacht and aircraft at the time — could avoid paying income taxes.Trump’s finances were leveraged dramatically in the early 1990s, according to the documents. A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns. When the audit ends, I’m going to present them. That should be before the election. I hope it’s before the election, he said last month.Full tax returns would reveal not only how much Trump earns, but what type of deductions he uses to reduce his taxes and how much he gives to charity.Clinton has released more than three decades worth of tax returns, with the eight most recent years posted on her website.The most detailed reports on Trump’s taxes come from a 1981 report from New Jersey’s gambling commission, which detailed Trump’s income and taxes from 1975 to 1979.Trump claimed income of $76,210, $24,594, and $118,530 in 1975-77, and paid federal taxes of $18,714, $10,832, and $42,386 in those years, according to the report. In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns.

President Barack Obama has long supported the ban of assault weapons, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days.  AP PhotoThe White House is stepping up its efforts to renew the assault weapons ban, while trying to boost separate gun control measures that the Senate plans to vote on next week.On Monday, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett will host a mass conference call for the general public about the need to renew the assault weapons ban and the different gun safety measures the Senate is set to vote on in the coming week.Vice President Joe Biden announced the call in a response to a petition on the White House’s We the People platform on Friday. The request for a ban on the AR-15 assault-style rifle was posted on Sunday, in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting in which were 49 people were killed, and already had nearly 200,000 signatures by Friday. The president and I agree with you, Biden wrote. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership.The Obama administration has pledged to respond to any petition that accumulates 100,000 signatures in a month. This was one of fastest we’ve ever had to cross the threshold, said a White House official.Obama has long supported the ban, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days, condemning the easy access to weapons of war like the Sig Sauer MCX that Omar Mateen used to kill many people at close range. But until Friday’s announcement, it was unclear whether his administration would do anything more substantial to mobilize for a ban.Hillary Clinton has also stepped up her calls for an assault weapons ban on the trail. However, on the Hill, Democrats have focused on getting votes for measures with broader support, including barring people on terror watch lists from buying guns and expanding background checks. The Senate is set to vote on variations of those measures on Monday — though barring major changes, none appear likely to pass.The AR-15 has become the most popular rifle in the country since the original assault weapons ban expired in 2004. In the wake of the Newtown shooting, as gun control groups have become more politically sophisticated, they’ve increasingly focused on measures like background checks to stress that their goal is to take guns out of the hands of dangerous people, not law-abiding Americans. They also not that must gun violence is committed with handguns.But the role of assault weapons in high-profile mass shootings gives the issue emotional weight. In his response, Biden noted that they were used in in Aurora, Colorado, to kill 12 people; in Roseburg, Oregon, to kill 10 and in Newtown, Connecticut, to kill 26.A single person killed that many people in just a few minutes. Not in a war zone. Here in America — in a classroom, Biden wrote.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Biden will be on a call about the assault weapons ban on Monday.

Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership.The Obama administration has pledged to respond to any petition that accumulates 100,000 signatures in a month. This was one of fastest we’ve ever had to cross the threshold, said a White House official.Obama has long supported the ban, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days, condemning the easy access to weapons of war like the Sig Sauer MCX that Omar Mateen used to kill many people at close range. But until Friday’s announcement, it was unclear whether his administration would do anything more substantial to mobilize for a ban.Hillary Clinton has also stepped up her calls for an assault weapons ban on the trail. However, on the Hill, Democrats have focused on getting votes for measures with broader support, including barring people on terror watch lists from buying guns and expanding background checks. The Senate is set to vote on variations of those measures on Monday — though barring major changes, none appear likely to pass.The AR-15 has become the most popular rifle in the country since the original assault weapons ban expired in 2004. In the wake of the Newtown shooting, as gun control groups have become more politically sophisticated, they’ve increasingly focused on measures like background checks to stress that their goal is to take guns out of the hands of dangerous people, not law-abiding Americans. They also not that must gun violence is committed with handguns.But the role of assault weapons in high-profile mass shootings gives the issue emotional weight. In his response, Biden noted that they were used in in Aurora, Colorado, to kill 12 people; in Roseburg, Oregon, to kill 10 and in Newtown, Connecticut, to kill 26.A single person killed that many people in just a few minutes. Not in a war zone. Here in America — in a classroom, Biden wrote.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Biden will be on a call about the assault weapons ban on Monday.                  Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to formally end his campaign for president.  AP PhotoHillary Clinton allies are beginning to put public pressure on Bernie Sanders to end his bid before the convention, suggesting the prospect of a prime time convention speech as an incentive.If I were advising Sen. Sanders, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a longtime Clinton ally, said in an interview, I would say, you’ve done so fabulously, but there’s one thing left you need to do and that’s make a speech in prime time at the convention. You only do that if you’re not contesting the nomination.If Sanders waits to hold a roll call in Philadelphia on the Wednesday of the convention, the only speaking slots left would likely go to President Obama and the party’s nominee. But if he conceded beforehand, Rendell said, Sanders would be in a position to demand a prime time slot on the stage at the Wells Fargo Center. A Clinton campaign spokesman would not discuss the internal convention negotiations underway with the Sanders campaign.But the public push from Clinton allies for Sanders to wrap up his campaign came after the Vermont Senator on Thursday night dodged an opportunity to concede to Clinton. During a 23-minute livestreamed address, Sanders, speaking to supporters from Burlington, said that defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. Network television stations cut away from Sanders as it became clear no concession was planned. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become, he said. And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia.When it came to Clinton, whom Sanders met with Tuesday night in Washington, D.C., he told some 200,000 supporters tuning in via livestream: It is no secret that Secretary Clinton and I have strong disagreements on some very important issues. It is also true that our views are quite close on others.Clinton officials and surrogates have come to expect nothing short of a stubborn and persistent challenge from Sanders over the course of a contentious campaign. But patience is wearing thin among Clinton allies for a vanquished rival who seems to be coming around to his party’s nominee at the speed of a tanker changing course, in an election when time is a scarce resource.The lack of processing, publicly, the fact that he has actually not won, is frustrating, said one Clinton surrogate with close ties to the campaign. Framing his desires as a list of demands when his margin of loss was actually significantly larger than he’s acting, is frustrating.Other Clinton allies described Sanders’ much-hyped speech as unsurprising, but lame nonetheless.  Bernie talks the language of collective action — but only if he is the center of that action, said the political director of a major labor union that endorsed Clinton. He doesnt understand the role of a party, and uniting behind a partys nominee. The address was viewed as an opportunity for Sanders to assure his supporters that he’s still fighting for the principles that energized his supporters, even as he winds down from actively campaigning. But some Clinton loyalists told POLITICO they resented his address because they believe the only reason for Sanders to carry on at this point is his unspoken hope that Clinton is somehow disqualified between now and the July 25 convention.Democratic strategist and former Obama aide Ben LaBolt noted, the clock is ticking for him to not only tell his supporters to defeat Donald Trump, but to get them excited about the ticket. He said he was a Democrat this cycle, that would imply that he would enthusiastically support the ticket.Rendell, however, said he’s willing to cut Sanders just a little more slack -- a mindset shared by campaign officials. I know a lot of Hillary supporters are piqued he didn’t concede, he said. Its Bernie being Bernie. Theres nothing to be upset about. He marches to a different drum.If he takes a week or two, it’s not important, Rendell added. What’s important is he gets the message out that he’s for Hillary before the convention. All the ship has to do is make land by July 25. Campaign officials also remained confident that after the Tuesday night meeting, the two candidates are on a slow path to party unification.Meanwhile, the process of unification is underway without Sanders on board. On Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another progressive standard bearer, rallied the troops at Clinton’s campaign headquarters with a rah rah speech to staffers. But from the outside, there is less certainty of what Sanders endgame strategy looks like.It’s hard to read, said Democratic strategist David Axelrod, also a former top adviser to President Obama, of his reaction to Sanders’ speech Thursday night. You don’t just charge forward at 100 miles an hour and come to a screeching halt, extend your hand and say, ‘Great game.’Sander is right to continue to promote the ideals that animated his race, Axelrod said. But if, as he says, his goal is to defeat Trump, persistent, if implied, lamentations about the shortcomings of the only person now in a position to achieve that goal are not helpful.At some point -- maybe in Philly, maybe before -- he has to land this plane, Axelrod said. And he needs to make the descent more gentle to avoid a crash landing.                 Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to formally end his campaign for president.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California on June 2.  GettyDonald Trump has made it a habit to mention and tweet out favorable poll numbers throughout the course of his campaign. But on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee thanked his millions of followers for the results of a national survey that showed him losing to Hillary Clinton.THANK YOU! #AmericaFirst, Trump tweeted, in a message showing the latest One America News Network/Gravis Marketing poll, which the graphic indicates is from Thursday.As shown in the collage, Clinton led Trump 51 percent to 49 percent.Clinton leads Trump by nearly six points — 44.1 percent to 38.3 percent — in the Real Clear Politics average of head-to-head national polls conducted between May 24 and Wednesday. And in POLITICOs continually updated Battleground States Polling Average, Clinton leads Trump by a similar margin, 45 percent to 40 percent.THANK YOU! #AmericaFirst pic.twitter.com/qp07UfnnjM— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2016Speaking to The New York Times on Thursday night, Trump made a rare admission that he is currently running behind his Democratic opponent.I’m four down in one poll, three and a half in another that just came out, and I haven’t started yet, Trump told the Times. And I have tremendous Republican support ... Unfortunately they never talk about that, they talk about the few rebels.Even so, Trump has said that he does not necessarily buy into the results of polls that show him losing, suggesting to his supporters that people are less likely to tell a pollster they are supporting him than they are to privately cast their vote for him.When I poll, I do fine, but when I run I do much better, Trump said at a rally in Dallas on Thursday night, summarizing what polling analysts call the Bradley effect. In other words, people say I’m not going to say who I’m voting for, don’t be embarrassed, I’m not going to say who I’m voting for and then they get it and I do much better, it’s like an amazing effect.

Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge.

Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win.

We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said in an interview Sunday he hates the concept of profiling, but at the same time is open to increasing profiling of American Muslims.In a discussion that mentioned the surveillance of American mosques and response to recent terrorist attacks, Face the Nation host John Dickerson asked Trump if he was open to having law enforcement officials single out Muslims in America.I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country, Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. Trump said it’s a concept that must be looked at seriously. He mentioned Israel and others as countries that successfully profile.We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, he said. And other countries do it. And it’s not the worst thing to do. I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to use common sense. we’re not using common sense.Dickerson also asked Trump if Muslims should receive extra scrutiny when buying ammunition and weapons.I don’t know about that, Trump said.

I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, Wayne LaPierre said of Donald Trumps suggestion that there couldve been guns at Pulse nightclub to stop the shooter.  GettyEfforts by Democrats to introduce new gun control legislation amount to little more than a smoke screen intended to shift attention away from failed policy to combat terrorism, National Rifle Association Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said Sunday.What happened this past week is the president, the whole gun ban movement said look over here, divert your attention, take your eyes off the problem, LaPierre told John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation.They don’t want to face the embarrassment of their failure in this terrorist area, and they want to cover their butts and not talk about it.LaPierre pointed to a measure introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that would notify law enforcement should a suspected terrorist attempt to buy a weapon as an acceptable compromise, but noted concerns voiced by FBI Director James Comey that stopping a terrorist from purchasing a weapon could actually alert that terrorist that he or she is under investigation. We need to look at all our vulnerabilities and we need to harden, because they’re coming and they’re going to try to kill us and we need to be prepared, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.The NRA CEO said as far as he knew, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in broad agreement with the association’s stance.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said, arguing that terrorists in California and Paris used firearms to kills dozens of people in places with strict gun laws. He called for armed security in vulnerable targets like malls, churches and schools but stopped short of suggesting that people in bars and nightclubs, like the one where 49 people were shot in Orlando, should be carrying guns.I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, he told Dickerson.Later, the NRA attempted to clarify LaPierres remarks in a post to Twitter. Its fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar that serves alcohol, the NRA wrote on LaPierres behalf, but not if you plan to drink.                  Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Fareed Zakaria: Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States?  AP PhotoRussian leader Vladimir Putin said he didnt praise presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump quite effusively as has been reported.Speaking to Fareed Zakaria during a panel discussion in St. Petersburg, Putin responded Friday to a question about his praise for Trump by saying: I only said that he was a bright person. Isn’t he bright? He is.Why do you always change the meaning of what I said? Putin asked in response to Zakarias question about Putin calling Trump brilliant.Zakaria acknowledged the word brilliant may have been a matter of imprecise translation. Putin had made the statement in December, drawing praise in return from Trump for his leadership ability.In the latest discussion, which aired Sunday on CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS, Putin did voice his approval of Trumps willingness to restore full-fledged Russian-American relations, but declined to offer additional support for Trump or anything much in the way of opinions about presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.We never interfere into the internal political processes of other countries, Putin said in his typically expressionless manner.The Russian president did take a slap at American self-righteousness toward other countries when it comes to adherence to democratic processes.Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States? Putin asked Zakaria, adding: Twice in American history, a president was elected who did not get the majority of votes.Putin, presumably, was referring to the elections of 1876 (Rutherford Hayes) and 2000 (George W. Bush) when the candidate who received the most votes did not win in the Electoral College.Putin did acknowledge Americas status in the world: The U.S. is a great power. At the moment, it is probably the only superpower and we accept this fact.The Russian leader said he didnt think the world was sliding toward a new Cold War but did take some digs, direct and indirect, at international sanctions and NATO, which he said needed an external enemy to justify its continued existence.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan took part in the panel discussion, which also focused on topics ranging from Ukraine to Russian athletic doping scandals.                 House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.  With the Senate set to vote on competing gun control amendments Monday, Sen. Jeff Sessions said Sunday that somehow, some way, we should be able to make this work.Like many other Republicans, Sessions (R-Ala.) expressed concern that legislation banning suspected terrorists from purchasing guns might infringe on the constitutional rights of those wrongly entered onto terrorism watch lists.He told CNN’s State of the Union that he would be willing to listen to a compromise proposal being crafted by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), praising her diligence and expertise on the various terrorism watch lists and the respective thresholds for inclusion on each one.But a lot of people may be wrongly on the list. In fact, I’m sure there are a lot of people on that list that shouldn’t be on it, Sessions said, without specifying which of the various terrorism watch lists he was speaking of. So if youre going to deny a person a Constitutional right like free speech or the right to have a firearm, then that person has to have an opportunity to explain that they shouldnt be on the list. … Thats what the difference is. Republicans have voted consistently to ban people on that list from having a gun, but to give them an opportunity to prove they shouldnt be on the list. Sessions, one of the most prominent supporters of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, defended the presumptive Republican nominee’s renewed call to temporarily ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Sessions explained that his understanding of Trump’s proposal is that the ban would target nations with a history of terrorist activity and would not prohibit diplomats and business travelers from moving between those nations and the U.S. The senator referred to the proposal as a tightening of immigration policy and named Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as countries that might fall under Trump’s proposal.Sessions also attacked what he called the talking heads in the Republican Party who have steadfastly refused to fall in line behind Trump as the party’s nominee, encouraging them to read Trump’s great speech on immigration and foreign policy last week. He contrasted Trump’s remarks with those of President Barack Obama, whose response has been unbelievably weak.Finally, Sessions said he was not in discussions with the Trump campaign about the possibility of becoming the candidate’s running mate but did reiterate that he’d consider joining the ticket if asked.I only said if I were asked I would consider it. I dont expect that to happen, Sessions said. I have no idea what theyre doing. I suspect people are thinking about it, but it will be an important decision. He needs somebody who can be a great president if something happens to him, somebody who can help him advance an agenda that I think is the American peoples agenda.                 I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said the FBI had a bad day when it didn’t follow up on a tip from a Florida gun shop owner that the gunman who killed 49 people in Orlando last weekend was acting suspiciously.The presumptive Republican nominee admitted that no system of background checks would successfully catch every terrorist looking to buy a gun, but he lamented the fact that the FBI had prior warning that an unidentified person who later turned out to be Orlando shooter Omar Mateen was acting suspiciously.This guy was, he was a bad dude. He was a bad dude. I mean, look, will somebody slip through? I guess, Trump told ABC’s This Week in an interview with Jonathan Karl. I guess the gun store owner reported him and the authorities didn’t act on it. What a shame.What does that say to you? Karl followed up.To me, it says very sad. They reported him and the authorities didn’t act, Trump replied. I think it’s very unusual. I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Florida, said Thursday that an unidentified person had come to his store several weeks back and tried to buy body armor, which Abells employees said they did not have. The would-be buyer left the store, and Abell said he reported the individual to the FBI as suspicious. The person, Abell realized after the shooting, was Mateen.In his interview with Karl, taped backstage at one of Trump’s rallies this weekend in Texas, the Republican candidate renewed his promise to talk to the National Rifle Association about banning suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. The presumptive nominee wouldn’t say whether he could budge the NRA on the issue, only that he wanted to find out their thinking.What I want, and I know what they want, they want it as much as anybody in the world, they want to make sure that terrorists don’t get guns, Trump said. I know that something really good is going to come out of all of this.                 Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice will release portions of the Orlando shooter’s calls to 911 during the shooting.Attorney General Loretta Lynch will go to Orlando this week to get an on-the-ground briefing as the investigation into last weekend’s terrorist attack at a gay nightclub continues.She also plans to meet with victims, their families and first responders during her visit to the site of the massacre by Omar Mateen, which left 49 people dead. I think what’s important is to continue to keep our focus on the victims of this tragic crime as well, Lynch said Sunday on ABCs This Week. One of the things Ill do in Orlando on Tuesday is meeting with victims, talking about the support well be providing them as well. Because this is a community, the LGBT and Latino community, that has come under fire before, but never in as horrific manner as this.Lynch also said the Department of Justice will release portions of the Orlando shooter’s calls to 911 during the shooting. She said the gunman’s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State will not be included in that release, but the transcripts will shed light on his motivations for carrying out the attack.In a wave of appearances across the Sunday morning political talk shows, Lynch defended the FBI’s previous interactions with Orlando shooter Loretta Lynch and explained why a tip from a Florida gun shop owner that a person, who later turned out to be the shooter, had acted suspiciously inside the store did not yield a more thorough investigation. She told CNN’s State of the Union that because the shooter had not made a purchase inside that gun store, no identifying information had been collected.                 It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump wants remaining Republicans to get on board with his campaign, but the presumptive GOP nominee says he doesn’t need them to win.Several prominent Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have lined up with varying levels of enthusiasm behind Trump. But others, like former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, have yet to throw their weight behind Trump. Some, including Mitt Romney and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have been loudly critical of their party’s nominee.But Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press that he can win in November, with or without their support.Were going to have a great convention and I think were going to go on to a great victory. It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together, he said.  I think that I win either way. I can win one way or the other.I obviously won the primaries without them, he continued. You know, Im an outsider and I won the primaries. I do believe that we can win either way, but it would be nice if we stuck together.The GOP nominee seemed unfazed by reports of a mounting effort to deny him the nomination at the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland. Characterizing it as a creation of the media, Trump scoffed at the notion that his pile of delegates could be snatched out from underneath him on the convention floor by a candidate who would like to come in through the back door.So I win 38 states and somebody else won none and they’re going to be the nominee? Trump said. I don’t think so.Trump also dismissed criticism that his campaign lacked the money and infrastructure in key battleground states to compete against the massive operation backing Democrat Hillary Clinton. The real estate mogul said he won’t need to spend as much as Clinton in order to win and added that should his campaign find itself short of funds, Trump would bankroll it on his own.She’s selling herself to Wall Street and the Wall Street fat cats are all putting up a lot of money for her. I don’t even want that kind of money, Trump said, borrowing a line of attack that Sen. Bernie Sanders used regularly against Clinton during the Democratic primary. I don’t think I need that money, frankly. I mean, look what we’re doing right now. This is like a commercial, right? Except it’s tougher than a normal commercial. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way.                 Billionaire Republican megadonor Charles Koch, pictured in 2012, gave $3 million to the Freedom Partners Action Fund.  AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.  Donald Trump has one month to pick a running mate, and Republican swing-state insiders are deeply divided over who he should choose.GOP members of The POLITICO Caucus – a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 10 key battleground states – splintered this week when asked to suggest who Trump should select to share the ticket with him this fall.Gaining the most support were former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (13 percent), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (9 percent), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (8 percent), former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (8 percent), Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst (7 percent) and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (7 percent).A plurality of Democratic and nonpartisan members see Rubio, who is reconsidering whether to retire from the Senate before next week’s filing deadline to run for reelection, as Trump’s strongest running mate. Given a list of seven possible choices, just over a third said Rubio would be Trump’s best possible pick — far more than any other individual potential candidate.For Republicans, though, the responses were a mix of serious suggestions and despair over Trump’s decision-making process and his odds in the November election.Gingrich, who left the House after the 1998 midterm elections and unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination four years ago, emerged as the narrow favorite.Hes intimately knowledgeable how Congress works and has a keen understanding of how to push the Executive Branch, said a Florida Republican, who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. Speaker Gingrich also brings the conservative credibility that should assuage some of the establishment class which is licking their wounds after being squeezed and beaten for the past year.He is excellent on his feet, added a Virginia Republican.Rubio, who has said he isn’t interested in being Trump’s running mate, was the second choice.Rubio understands public policy, hes smart, has great legislative experience, hes young, good looking and Hispanic – and women like him, said a Colorado Republican.Trump also needs Rubios expertise with regard to the politics, a Wisconsin Republican added.Rubio would be the strongest choice for Trump, Democratic insiders said, though they are confident the youthful Floridian won’t join the ticket.It is not going to happen, said a Nevada Democrat, but Rubio would have best opportunity to help Trump broaden his base.Added a North Carolina Democrat: The question is if Rubio is willing to destroy his political future for the sake of saving his party.Unlike Rubio, Kasich hasn’t even endorsed the presumptive GOP nominee – but a number of GOP insiders said they wanted him on the ticket[Trump] needs stability and Ohio, said one Virginia Republican.And Rice, the former secretary of state, was praised for her foreign policy chops – and her ability to negate a likely Trump weakness.She has everything that Trump does not, everything, said a Florida Republican.The other two potential candidates to earn significant support were Ernst, the first-term Iowa senator, and Sessions, the immigration hawk from Alabama.Ernst with her military background, genuine likeability and personality, work ethic and a quick grasp of issues would complement a Trump ticket and help in swing, purple states around the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest, said an Iowa Republican.[Ernst] has legislative experience, but she has not been in Washington long enough to be tainted, added a New Hampshire Republican.For many GOP insiders long resistant to Trump, the vice-presidential question was an opportunity to tee off on the real-estate mogul. One Iowa Republican said being Trump’s running mate was like being first mate on the Titanic.No one should have to endure that, added an Ohio Republican. No one remembers who Goldwaters running mate was, but at least that person had some honor, a New Hampshire Republican said. The one who says yes to Trump will not. It wont matter, except for the poor unfortunate soul who will gain the worlds worst resume line, said a Virginia Republican.I dont see any rational political figure accepting this suicide mission except those with an exaggerated ego and self-inflated thoughts of political superego, a Florida Republican said.Anyone willing to share the ticket with Donald Trump is unfit for the office of the vice president, insisted an Iowa Republican.There is no one Trump can pick that would make him palatable, said a Pennsylvania Republican.One area where Trump did earn some plaudits from GOP insiders: the idea of announcing his running-mate pick during next month’s national party convention in Cleveland. Fifty-nine percent of Republican insiders said that was a good idea, while 41 percent said it wasn’t, and that Trump should roll out his pick before the convention.Picking a running mate during the convention might be a PR stunt, but it could reinforce Trumps brand as going against the grain, said a Florida Republican. And only Trump has the showmanship to pull it off.Surprises are rare in politics, an Ohio Republican added. It would be beneficial.But some Republicans said Trump needs to announce his pick before Cleveland, especially with some discussing a revolt to deny him the nomination.People are talking about changing the rules to introduce another nominee. Dissatisfaction with Trump is growing among Republicans, not waning, said a New Hampshire Republican. His VP choice is all he has left if he wants any chance at all of uniting the party behind him.Weve seen this approach twice in the last three decades, added an Iowa Republican. Odd 11th-hour, manufactured drama produced Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin.One Ohio Republican suggested that approach could harm Trump’s credibility.This is not a reality show, the Republican said. I can only imagine the cut shots to the horrified faces of delegates when Sarah Palin walks out.These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this survey:Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob WitwerFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

Sen. Ron Johnson on the GOP situation: I think things remain reasonably uncertain.  APLocked in a tough fight for reelection this November, Sen. Ron Johnson said Sunday he plans to support Donald Trump for president but didnt formally endorse the presumptive nominee.There’s a big difference between the two, the Wisconsin senator explained on CNN’s State of the Union after saying he intends to support the Republican nominee.Well to me, he told Dana Bash, endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything, Johnson said. Thats not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I’ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. Ill voice it, whether its Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else.Trump’s controversial candidacy could spell trouble for Johnson this fall, who faces a stiff challenge from former Sen. Russ Feingold, whom Johnson ousted in 2010. A recent Marquette University Law School poll shows Johnson trailing Feingold, 51 percent to 42 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters.Johnson was not willing to dismiss the notion that Trump’s nomination might come undone at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland even though Trump would seem to have more than enough delegates. He said that while he’s not a part of any movement to deny Trump the GOP nomination, nobody can really predict whats going to be the outcome of our nomination process.He also made that point about unpredictability in discussing his support for Trump: It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee. And again nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. So I think things remain reasonably uncertain.                 Sen.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney. Woodbury, who has been a delegate to the last six national conventions, won’t be a delegate in Cleveland.Trump’s fraught relationship with the LDS community starts at the top: Romney has been one of the GOP’s most persistent and vocal critics of the nominee. During the GOP primary, Trump questioned the sincerity of Romney’s faith and consistently lost parts of the country with heavy Mormon populations — like eastern Idaho and Utah.Recent general election polls out of heavily Mormon, deep-red Utah have newly underscored Trump’s broader challenge with the community—a community that is troubled by, among other things, his hostile language toward Hispanic immigrants (many Mormons do missions to South America) and his waffling on social issues. The LDS church, which itself suffered much discrimination in the past, released a statement in December saying, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns. However, it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom. The statement came as Trump pushed a proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration. According to the recent most recent Utah poll, Trump is deadlocked with Hillary Clinton in Utah — in a state that hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1964.I cannot go there, said Heidi Wixom, a Nevada Mormon and GOP activist well-respected in the community, of voting for Trump. Pointing to the list of incendiary comments he has made about other minority groups, she continued, Belonging to a church that has felt persecution, you wonder, will his rhetoric continue on? What happens to a group of people he sees aren’t supportive of him? What would he do to them?Trump’s Mormon issue may be felt acutely in a swing state like Nevada. Despite twice voting for Barack Obama, it’s still considered a November battleground. Trump ran well there in the Nevada caucuses but he’ll need an energized base to push him over the finish line. Enthusiastic LDS backing alone won’t be enough to win the state—as Romney demonstrated—but the chilly reception Trump is receiving from top community leaders could help ensure that Nevada stays blue.Wixom said that she spoke with around 40 fellow LDS Republicans in Nevada on Thursday.

They’re not supporting at large. They’re tolerating and voting. They’re not going to be putting Trump signs in the yards, they’re not going to be rallying around phone calls, they’re not going to help with grassroots efforts.But it’s still early, stressed Ira Hansen, a Mormon Republican assemblyman and the assistant majority floor leader, adding that he expects the community to eventually embrace Trump—at least enough to help him over the finish line. That’s what Hansen did after his favored candidate, Ted Cruz, dropped out.I think we’ll find, when push comes to shove, his platform comes out, a lot of people will rally around, in the LDS community and elsewhere, Hansen said, noting that a solid vice presidential pick and more details on Supreme Court choices could further smooth that path.He went on to add, It’s way premature to start determining what people are going to start doing in August, September, October. The reality is, we haven’t had a convention, we don’t know who the picks are going to be as far as vice president, the Supreme Court, a lot of things that could make a dramatic turnaround.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment and questions about Trump’s Mormon outreach efforts.Plenty of Mormon leaders are adamant that even if Trump eventually gets their votes, he won’t get much of their time.I’m most likely to vote Trump, Christensen said.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee.

Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls by increasing margins, Donald Trump dug himself a deeper hole with his response to the shootings in Orlando, Fla., this week.That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 10 key battleground states. Large majorities in both parties are convinced Trump struck the wrong chords in his public statements and Twitter posts after a gunman shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub early Sunday morning.A combined 72 percent of GOP insiders said Trump’s response to the incident was only fair or poor — with nearly half of all Republicans rating it poor. Only 8 percent said Trump’s response was excellent, and 20 percent rated it good.Among Democratic insiders, it was virtually unanimous: 99 percent rated Trump’s response as poor. The other 1 percent chose only fair.Republicans’ main objection? Trump’s seemingly self-congratulatory tweets in which he said people were giving him credit for predicting the rise of terrorist attacks in the U.S.Only an a--hole says ‘I told you so’ the same day 49 people are killed on American soil by a terrorist, said a New Hampshire Republican, who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. And only an a--hole would really believe Trump predicted or understood something unique — everyone who knows anything at all about whats happening has warned against the potential terror that can be unleashed by homegrown extremists.This issue should play right into his hand and be devastating against Hillary [Clinton], added a Pennsylvania Republican, but Trump made it all about his handling of it and not about the actual national security impact.A number of Republicans also cited Trump’s insinuation that President Barack Obama was somehow complicit in the murders.This was his chance to be himself and turn this election in his favor, and he instead introduced a new conspiracy theory suggesting the president knew something of the attack before it happened, an Iowa Republican said. 9/11 and Pearl Harbor-truthers rejoice! Your candidate has arrived!Some Republicans were more receptive to Trump’s response, crediting him for his criticism of the Obama administration for its approach to terrorism at home and abroad.Better the idiocy of Trump who can at least name the threat than the ignorance and incompetence of Obama/Clinton whose refusal to confront radical Islam puts us all in more danger every day, said an Ohio Republican.He has the right position, but says it completely wrong, a Florida Republican added. He doesnt realize that hes in the general election and is still running as if hes in a Republican primary.And one New Hampshire Republican gave Trump credit for trying to appeal to the gay community following the attacks — though the Republican faulted his execution.He was smart to make a play for the LGBT community — he just shouldnt have been so ham-handed about it, said the New Hampshire Republican.A few GOP insiders were unnerved by his suggestion later in the week that he’d be open to discussing tightening the nation’s gun laws.First response YES! exclaimed an Iowa Republican. Now with his change of heart on guns, I dont know how I feel.Another Iowa Republican hated both reactions, however: A d--- response of ‘I was right,’ now pivoting to support for gun control — denying American citizens due process before taking away constitutional rights.The universally negative response from Democratic insiders cited many of the same reasons: Trump’s apparent self-congratulation, and his intimations about Obama’s role.Poor doesnt even begin to describe it, said a Florida Democrat. Offensive. Wrong. Disqualifying. As a gay man from Florida, who has spent many nights with friends dancing at Pulse, the attack hit very close to home. Before knowing if my friends or family members were among the victims, Donald Trump was making it about himself. While I was praying for those who died, Trump was seeking to divide us rather than heal the nation.Ultimately, Trump’s response left some Republican insiders even more despondent about the party’s apparent nominee.For those who think Trump is sabotaging himself because he secretly doesnt want to be [president], said a Colorado Republican, they will find further evidence in his response to the tragedy in Orlando.I wish there was a category below ‘poor,’ one Virginia Republican said. Like ‘Unworthy of a Great Republic.’ Or ‘An Embarrassment to All That is Decent and Good.’These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this survey:Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob WitwerFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team. But it took a perfect storm for Edwards to triumph in 2015, and there doesn’t appear to be a GOP candidate in the race with Vitter’s personal, party label-defying vulnerabilities.Visit the Campaign Pro Race Dashboard to track the candidates and consulting firms engaged in the top House, Senate, and gubernatorial races of 2016. Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team.

AP PhotoDonald Trump says he isnt worried about delegates organizing against him at the Republican National Convention next month — but he spent a large part of his rally in Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon insisting that it wont happen.The presumptive Republican nominee, speaking from the Treasure Island hotel and casino, insisted that the story is all made up by the press. Its a hoax.POLITICO reported on Friday the efforts by dozens of anti-Trump delegates to block Trump from securing the GOP nomination in Cleveland. Republican National Committee officials and party leaders have dismissed the idea that someone other than Trump could be the nominee, but the effort is one of the most significant to come together since the Republican primary ended.Who are they going to pick? I beat everybody, Trump said. I beat the hell out of them. And we’re going to beat Hillary.Trump continued: And it’d be helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit. Trump also suggested that if Republicans don’t unite behind him, he’ll move forward by funding his own campaign.If they don’t want to help out as much, I’ll fund my own campaign, he said. Id love to do that.Continuing to fund his own campaign, Trump said, would be the easy way to go about raising money.I’ll just keep doing what I’m doing, he said.                 At every turn, Donald Trump has defied the hopes and expectations of those who believed he wouldn’t run.  AP PhotoHow much would it cost to get Donald Trump to give up his presidential run and walk away?I bet if someone offered him $150 million to drop out, he would, one former Trump adviser told POLITICO, unprompted, during an interview Friday.Asked about whether Trump would drop out, another former Trump adviser, Jim Dornan said he believes the presumptive GOP nominee would be willing to cut a deal. Yeah, probably, Dornan, a veteran Republican operative who worked for Trump last spring on an abortive effort to set up a super PAC, replied via text message — adding there would be plenty of interest in buying him out. The Kochs would be the first in line.Trump himself says it’s a ridiculous proposition and that he’s not a fan of the question.This story is a total fabrication from you and POLITICO, as usual, the New York billionaire said in an email sent by his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. I will never leave the race, nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race, and if they did, it would be totally illegal anyway. Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?Indeed, it would be an unprecedented move for a presumptive major party nominee to drop out of a presidential race, for money or otherwise. It also seems extremely improbable that Trump, after a full year of campaigning and putting millions into his campaign, would walk away right before claiming the prize after having bested 16 rivals for the nomination.But even if it is only a fantasy, its a popular one. When the former adviser’s $150 million postulation was posted on Twitter, it sparked a social media flurry, with intense interest from anti-Trump Republicans and liberals alike. The wishful thinking of many political observers eager to entertain the far-fetched scenario reflects the still-growing fears among Republican elites about Trump’s potential to damage the party, the growing desperation among some Republican elites for an alternative to Trump or Hillary Clinton, and the persistence of doubts about Trump’s commitment to the race that have dogged his candidacy from the start.At every turn, Trump has defied the hopes and expectations of those who believed he wouldn’t run, wouldn’t file a personal financial disclosure, or would drop out before the first primary votes were cast. And following weeks in which Trump took a tumble in the polls and infuriated many in his own party with attacks on the heritage of a Mexican-American judge and response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, hope for some sort of deus ex machina salvation from Trump springs eternal.Done.

Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together.                 House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.  Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge. Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win.

Scene outside Philadelphias City Hall as gatherers hold a candle light vigil for those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.   M. Scott MahaskeyThe House on Thursday blocked an amendment that opponents said would have taken away critical intelligence tools just four days after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The 198-222 vote is a blow for privacy advocates who have spent years building support for the amendment, which would have barred the government from forcing companies to weaken their encryption for law enforcement. The provision passed the House twice in 2014 and 2015 by wide margins, before being stripped each time during conferences with the Senate.But Sunday’s deadly assault in Orlando, in which suspected Islamic State supporter Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, caused a drastic erosion in support for the language. Opponents cited the attack as the main reason Congress couldn’t approve the amendment.This amendment prohibits the government from searching data already in its possession collected lawfully … to determine whether Omar Mateen was in contact [with terrorists overseas], said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) during the extended debate over the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations bill.Investigators have said they’re trying to determine whether Mateen communicated with any terrorist groups at home or abroad — a task that would be made more difficult if he used encryption to shield data on his phone or computer.Privacy advocates accused Goodlatte and other detractors of using fear tactics to reduce support for what has been a widely supported House amendment for two years running.It’s unfortunate my colleagues would take advantage of that situation, said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who co-sponsored the amendment with Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). The language does not take any tools away from those that want to investigate what happened in Orlando, Massie insisted.Advocates argue that the provision merely prevents the NSA or the CIA from requiring anyone to alter their products to allow digital snooping. They say this would preserve the encryption that protects the nation’s power grid, air traffic control system and all smartphones.Our government should strengthen the technology, Lofgren said, not take advantage of it.The Massie-Lofgren amendment will make America safer, she added.But national security-focused lawmakers worry that fully encrypted devices, such as the latest iPhones, and a growing array of encrypted apps are preventing authorities from reading digital communications even when they have a lawfully issued warrant. The dispute came to the fore following December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., when the FBI took Apple to court in an attempt to force the tech giant to help the Bureau crack into an iPhone used by shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The Justice Department dropped the San Bernardino case after the FBI said an unidentified third party helped it unlock Farook’s phone, leaving the larger legal question unresolved. The Manhattan district attorney’s office alone has said it has more than 270 iPhones that it’s been unable to crack. Sunday’s deadly attack proves once again that the terror threat has not dissipated, Goodlatte said. Now is not the time to block a critical investigative tool.Thursday’s vote represents a shift in congressional priorities since former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the extent of the government’s clandestine surveillance apparatus.In the wake of those disclosures, liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans came together to press for surveillance reform. Eventually, the bipartisan coalition pushed through the USA Freedom Act, the first major rollback of the NSA’s spying authorities in a generation. The House also got the Massie-Lofgren amendment approved 293-123 in 2014 and 255-174 the next year as part of two annual spending bills.But following major terror attacks both at home — in San Bernardino and Orlando — and abroad — in Paris and Brussels — hawkish lawmakers have moved to retain or expand government surveillance authorities.Numerous hawkish lawmakers have introduced bills to either delay surveillance reforms or strengthen the government’s ability to collect data. A widely supported email privacy bill — which would require law enforcement to seek a warrant before accessing stored email — is even being held up in the Senate over an amendment that would let the FBI use national security letters to obtain email and Internet metadata.                 The U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians.  John Shinkle/POLITICOThe House of Representatives is telling the military to lower the volume. Lawmakers who have been advocating for reducing the size and cost of military bands — now a half-billion-dollar a year enterprise — won a key victory Thursday with passage of a provision that would bar funding for musical units to play at dinners, dances or social events.The provision, the handiwork of Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, would ensure funds are not spent on entertaining generals, dignitaries and elected officials, all the different type of things that have nothing to do with appropriate military ceremonies but reserved for ceremonial tasks such as funerals.Her bipartisan amendment to the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations act was approved by voice vote.From their humble origins in the American Revolution’s fife-and-drum corps, the U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians — with some members outfitted with $11,000 flutes and $12,000 tubas. For every dollar that is spent on our bands ... to entertain at social functions, thats a dollar were not spending on national security and our troops and our families, McSally said.The band budget has drawn criticism from several lawmakers, including House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who said military bands may not be appropriate at every event.The vote marks the first successful attempt to try to scale back the overall budget for military bands. The amendment was cosponsored by New Mexico Republican Steve Pearce and Minnesota Democrat Betty McCollum, who tried herself several years ago to cap the spending on bands.McCollum in 2011 and 2012 proposed a $200 million annual spending limit on military bands, but the effort got heavy pushback inside the ranks and on Capitol Hill, who argued military musicians are a critical link between the men and women in uniform and those they protect. McSally, an Arizona Republican has made it no secret she hopes to curtail use of the musicians for entertainment purposes, and has spoken out often about how such funds could be better spent to directly support ongoing military operations.She told POLITICO that because military bands are funded through operation and maintenance accounts in each service, with this amendment, We wanted to make sure we werent looking like we were wanting to cut funding to the military personnel account.McSallys had sent a letter, urging her colleagues to back the measure, which she said will ensure military bands perform their proper duties and limit their performances to official ceremonies, honoring the fallen, and playing taps.The amendment comes on top of legislation in the Houses version of the defense authorization act passed last month that would require the Pentagon to determine whether it could ease cuts in combat units by reducing the number of musicians.The language requires the Government Accountability Office to review the cost and size of military bands. It also directs Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take an inventory of the bands and study the feasibility of combining some.It remains unclear whether the Houses decision will prevail when a final appropriations bill is hashed out with the Senate. There is likely to be significant pushback.                  The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office. Its difficult to imagine the old John McCain being this reckless with something so serious, said Kirkpatrick, who is running to unseat McCain from the Senate this November.

John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington. In a private meeting of Democrats on Wednesday, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) begged his colleagues to push a measure that might have actually prevented Sunday morning’s carnage in Orlando: an assault weapons ban.Cicilline was answering the call of President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, to keep weapons of war off the streets. But Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi nixed it. Better, she said, to focus on barring terror suspects from buying guns. That measure’s a no-brainer for Democrats, she reasoned, and easier to explain to the public. It’s not that we’re not strong enough to make the fight. It’s just that we want to win the fight, Pelosi said to her Democratic colleagues, according to sources in the room. What we are trying to do — and forget the politics — what we are trying to do is save lives. What we are trying to do is to say that the Republicans will not even go to this place which overwhelmingly the American people support.The top gun control advocates in the country share Pelosi’s strategy, as do Senate Democrats. They want to emphasize measures that have broad support — like expanding background checks — rather than trying to take America’s most popular rifle and its copy-cat semi-automatics (like the Sig Sauer MCX used in Orlando) off the shelves. Pelosi aides note, however, that she was a supporter of the 1994 assault weapons ban and has repeatedly called for its reinstatement.We work hard to try to stay out of the polarizing divisiveness that comes with this debate, said Mark Barden, who founded Sandy Hook Promise after his 7-year-old son Daniel was killed three years ago by a mentally ill young man with a Bushmaster AR-15. He doesnt believe those types of firearms have any practical application for untrained civilians, Barden said. However, we’ve identified the lack of engagement as really the No. 1 issue that is keeping this movement from moving forward. By steering around that, we feel like we can bring more people and more voices.Barden, reached on Thursday just after returning to Connecticut following a fundraiser in Washington, added, I want to get something done.Banning the AR-15 and other assault weapons just plays into the National Rifle Association’s warnings about the feds coming to take your guns, gun control advocates reason — and besides, most of the gun deaths that have become miserably routine are committed with handguns. The ban isn’t part of the Everytown for Gun Safety’s platform, said spokeswoman Lizzie Ulmer, though the Michael Bloomberg-backed group is sympathetic to the urge to bar weapons that put the mass in mass shootings. Ulmer said that background checks are the key to keeping dangerous people from using guns to hurt themselves and others.When you take a step back and look at preventing gun violence, it’s really about stopping guns from getting into the hands of these people, Ulmer said. That approach is shared by Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, both of whom stress their personal gun ownership and support for Second Amendment rights. There’s already evidence, meanwhile, that the no fly, no buy campaign is driving a wedge between the NRA and Republicans: Donald Trump, despite receiving a relatively early endorsement from the top gun rights group, drew the line with them on Twitter on Wednesday when he declared that he would meet with its leaders about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns. That prompted a rebuke from Heritage Action on Thursday, which viewed Trump as getting on board with Clinton and congressional Democrats.It took nearly 15 hours of filibustering on the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday for Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to win the promise of votes on background check and terror watch list measures — important statement votes that are widely expected to fail.Nonetheless, many Democrats say they should be pushing for more amid unprecedented unity over gun control. Gay rights groups, teachers unions, immigration advocates and even abortion rights groups have signed on to the cause of gun violence prevention after mass shootings at a gay night club’s Latin night in Orlando, a black church in Charleston, an abortion clinic in Colorado Springs and schools around the country.Cicilline is pushing for a discharge petition in the House, which would require every member to go on the record on an assault weapons ban. He’s getting back-up from the progressive movement: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has collected over 26,000 signatures in support of the discharge petition over the last 24 hours. MoveOn.org has collected more than half a million signatures calling for a ban generally.At major national moments, the lowest common denominator solutions aren’t enough, said PCCC’s Sarah Badawi in an interview Thursday.Obama on Thursday found himself once again expressing grief over another mass shooting, and made sure to talk up the dire risk of assault weapons.Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families, Obama said in Orlando after meeting with survivors and victims’ families. The shooter used a Sig Sauer MCX to kill 49 people and injure 53 others — a high-powered gun that would likely be taken off shelves under an assault weapons ban. Clinton, who highlighted guns as a key area where she was to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, has consistently advocated for an assault weapons ban on the trail. Perhaps more remarkable is her husband’s fresh call for tighter security on the AR-15 after Orlando. Its pretty clear that if youre firing … a lot of ammunition in a short amount of time with a weapon thats designed only to kill, more people will die than if youre stuck with a pistol, Bill Clinton said Tuesday. If the guy had just had a pistol in that nightclub, I dont think anybody believes he could possibly have killed 49 people.That’s in contrast to the weeks after Sandy Hook, when he said the 1994 assault weapons ban had devastated Democrats in that year’s midterms and warned his party not to overplay its hand.While Obama has talked about an assault weapons ban multiple times since the Orlando massacre last weekend, he has yet to mount a big political push for it. Polling also makes clear the higher pay-off for less aggressive measures. While support for a ban has spiked in the wake of Orlando (57 percent of respondents in a CBS poll released on Wednesday back a ban, up from 44 percent in December), almost 9-in-10 Americans support universal background checks, according to that poll, including 82 percent of gun owners. Those figures have held relatively steady since Newtown.That overwhelming support for background checks — along with studies on their effectiveness in reducing gun crime — were why researchers at the liberal Center for American Progress deemed that professional gun control advocates’ shift in focus to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns is appropriate in 2014.However, some Democrats point to strategic benefits of having a vote on assault weapons, even if it’s a lost cause — it’s easier to vote for reasonable gun restrictions if you’re drawing a line on the extreme gun grab. Sixteen Democratic senators voted against the assault weapons ban on April 17, 2013, including the current head of their campaign arm, Montana’s Jon Tester. Yet all but four of them voted in favor of proceeding with expanded background check legislation that same day. Sen. Joe Donnelly used the specter of the ban to explain his vote in favor of the background checks. History shows that Congress begins re-examining proposals that would infringe on citizens 2nd Amendment rights, like the assault weapons ban, which I oppose, only when someone who shouldnt have had guns in the first place uses them to commit mass murder, he said at the time.  When Democrats go on offense and shift the conversation about these bigger ideas, that puts more oxygen in the room to have the conversation about these more important elements, PCCC’s Badawi said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for an assault weapons ban who introduced the 2013 version, said she still feels as strongly.In light of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, I believe we have an obligation to revisit this issue, Feinstein said in a statement Tuesday, adding that she was considering re-introducing the bill and conferring with colleagues. A spokeswoman said Thursday that Feinstein had yet to make a decision.                  President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, in honor of people killed in the shooting at a gay nightclub.  GettyPresident Barack Obama on Thursday demanded that lawmakers put politics aside and move forward on the longstanding impasse over gun legislation in the wake of the latest tragedy.  Obama found himself consoling families of the victims of an Orlando, Florida, massacre that Congress had done little to prevent through legislation, even after mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado.  Today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents and they asked why does this keep happening, Obama said Thursday, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden. And they pleaded that we do more to stop the carnage. They don’t care about the politics. Neither do I. Neither does Joe. And neither should any parent out here.The president spoke for nearly 18 minutes, sharing anecdotes he heard from families and thanking first responders, medical personnel and law enforcement for their response efforts. But he also emphasized the reality of what prompted his visit.   Four days ago this community was shaken by an evil and hateful act, he said.  Indeed, Omar Mateen, a New York-born Florida resident who had pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history Sunday when he rampaged through an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others before he was shot dead by police.As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description, Obama said of the families he and Biden met with. Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives.Obama noted that the families impacted by the Orlando massacre could be any American families.In fact, they are our family. They’re part of the American family, he said. Today, the vice president and I told them on behalf of the American people that our hearts are broken, too, and that we stand with you and that we are here for you and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply.The latest terror attack reignited the debate over gun restrictions. Though Mateen had been investigated by the FBI multiple times, he was able to purchase firearms, including the long gun he used to slaughter 49 people and injure dozens more. This debate needs to change. It’s outgrown the old political stalemates, Obama said of the deadlock over guns. The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why this makes sense.While pledging that the U.S. will ultimately destroy the Islamic State and other terrorist networks with its relentlessness — by disrupting their networks, financing, fighters and propaganda — Obama acknowledged that the past two terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were homegrown and that more needs to be done to stop such events from recurring.If you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we’re gonna have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening, he said before pointing specifically to what transpired in Orlando. Now those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead. Another 53 are injured. Some are still fighting for their lives. Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.Senate Democrats launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster Wednesday to force votes on gun control legislation and expect to vote on gun measures Tuesday. But there’s little hope those votes will result in new laws that restrict assault weapons or other, more modest measures. Obama said he was pleased that the Senate would hold votes but challenged them to do the right thing. I truly hope that senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope that senators who voted ‘no’ on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart, and then I hope the House does the right thing and helps end the plague of violence that these weapons of war inflict on so many young lives, he said.He reiterated that the U.S. can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person who wants to harm others but maintained that by taking action on gun restrictions, Congress can limit the damage being done.Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora or Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally, he continued. I’ve said this before: We will not be able to stop every tragedy. We can’t wipe away hatred and evil from every heart in this world. But we can stop some tragedies. We can save some lives. We can reduce the impact of a terrorist attack if we’re smart. And if we don’t act, he warned, we will keep seeing more massacres like this because we’ll be choosing to allow them to happen. We will have said we don’t care enough to do something about it.Obama contended that Sunday’s attack wasn’t a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rather, he said, they were having fun at a place they considered to be a safe haven.Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way imaginable, Obama said. This was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community. Americans were targeted because we’re a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love. Now if we’re honest with ourselves, if in fact we wanna show the best of our humanity, then we’re all gonna have to work together at every level of government across political lines to do more to stop killers who wanna terrorize us, he added. Principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters during a gaggle en route to Orlando that Obama has had to embark on these trips with too much regularity, but emphasized that the president wanted to meet privately with the families of victims, survivors and law enforcement. He wants to make sure that those families who are going through this unimaginable pain know that the president of the United States is there with them, Schultz said. For understandable and obvious reasons, those conversations will not be in front of the cameras. This healing process is not going to happen overnight. Its not going to be a quick one. Thats all the more reason why the president wanted to be there in person. Obama exited Air Force One on Thursday afternoon alongside Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Corrine Brown, all of whom were greeted by Biden, Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Bill Nelson, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs. The White House said Obama and Biden met with law enforcement officials to thank them for their actions in responding to the attack ahead of a separate meeting with families and survivors, which pool reports indicate lasted about two hours. They also met with owners and staff of the nightclub where the carnage occurred. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J.

As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains.

As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes.

A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns.

In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns.

I don’t think we should have to beg, infer and guess. In 2016’s race to the bottom, Donald Trump is going to find out if you can become president when two-thirds of Americans don’t like you — and a majority can’t stand you.Recent polls have showed Trump’s unfavorable rating spiking again, after a brief improvement last month. That’s also coincided with a slide in national horse-race polls, which now unanimously show Hillary Clinton leading the presumptive Republican nominee. Clinton is also more unpopular than past nominees, but her negatives are neither as wide nor as deep as the broadly detested Trump.Trump is setting modern records for political toxicity — at least for a major-party candidate this far out from an election. Seventy percent of Americans surveyed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, up 10 points over the past month. The poll showed Trump’s favorable rating cratering at 29 percent, down from 37 percent last month.The numbers were similar in a Bloomberg Politics poll: Trump’s favorable rating is just 31 percent, with 66 percent viewing him unfavorably. That’s only marginally better than in March, when 29 percent viewed Trump favorably, and 68 percent had an unfavorable opinion.Gallup’s latest figures show Trump at 31 percent favorable/63 percent unfavorable – significantly worse than Clinton’s 41 percent favorable/54 percent unfavorable.Those high unfavorables extend to the battleground states: A Marquette Law School poll out Wednesday found 64 percent of Wisconsin voters view Trump unfavorably — compared to only 26 percent who have a favorable opinion of him.But it’s not just the overall unfavorable numbers — it’s the intensity of the antipathy toward Trump, and the lack of enthusiasm for him. In the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 56 percent of respondents had a strongly unfavorable opinion of Trump, compared to just 15 percent who had a strongly favorable opinion. In the Bloomberg poll, 51 percent had a very unfavorable opinion of Trump, with only 11 percent having a very favorable opinion.Voters with a strongly unfavorable opinion are obviously more difficult to move than people who are undecided or just unfavorable, said Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown. The stronger the dislike, the more difficult it is to change that person’s view.Clinton’s image ratings are also upside-down — but compared with Trump, she’s more than likable enough. The ABC News/Washington Post poll pegs her favorable rating at 43 percent (25 percent strongly favorable), with 55 percent viewing her unfavorably (39 percent strongly unfavorable). That’s a new low-water mark for Clinton, though it’s still only a slight decline since the campaign began. (The Bloomberg poll was similar for Clinton: 43 percent favorable, 54 percent unfavorable.)Clinton is seeking to move those numbers in her direction. On Thursday, the presumptive Democratic nominee launched a series of swing-state television ads, some aimed at boost her image and others hitting Trump.Trump’s unpopularity is without historical peer in the modern era of presidential campaigns. Mitt Romney averaged a 46-percent unfavorable rating in mid-June 2012, according to the HuffPost Pollster database. John McCain’s unfavorable rating four years prior was only 40 percent, and more voters had a positive opinion of the Arizona senator than a negative one. In June 2004, then-Sen. John Kerry had a 58-percent favorable rating, according to Gallup, with only 35 percent viewing him unfavorably. Also from Gallup: Al Gore, in late June 2000, had a 52-percent favorable rating, and Bob Dole had a 55-percent favorable rating in June 1996.Then-President George H.W. Bush is the last candidate to have a majority-unfavorable rating in June of an election year (51 percent unfavorable in June 1992), according to Gallup. But Bill Clinton’s unfavorable rating that year (47 percent) was also high. In May 1988, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, Michael Dukakis had an otherworldly 67-percent favorable rating, with just 10 percent viewing him unfavorably.The Dukakis figures offer a historical warning: The former Massachusetts governor had a significant lead over Bush entering the summer of 1988, but Bush overtook and soundly defeated Dukakis later that year. By early October, Dukakis’ stellar image rating had been slashed in half: More voters in a CBS News/New York Times poll by that time viewed Dukakis unfavorably than favorably.But Gallup editor in chief Frank Newport sees some parallels in the 1992 campaign. Unfavorable opinions of Bush reached as high as 57 percent in the fall, when he was in the heat of combat, Newport said.And Ross Perot, the independent Texas billionaire who won nearly 19 percent of the vote, saw his negatives enter Trump territory, Newport said.There were times when Perot had a 66-percent unfavorable rating, said Newport, which is comparable to where we have Trump right now.Bill Clinton, too, had high negatives in that race until the Democratic convention in New York, which began his turnaround. Newport said it was too soon to speculate whether Trump, a master showman, could use the Cleveland GOP convention next month to engineer a similar turnaround. But he suggested voters’ perceptions of Trump could be too baked-in for the Republican nominee to pull it off.Clinton had a remarkably positive convention that summer and suddenly became wildly popular, Newport said. Perhaps you could argue Clinton was a little newer on the scene in ’92 than Trump is now.Brown, the Quinnipiac pollster, attributed a line to former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.Will the United States elect a president whom more than half the people view unfavorably? Brown said. Today, the answer to that question looks like it might be yes. BURLINGTON, Vt. — Leverage: it’s the one thing Bernie Sanders’ advisors and aides consistently point to when asked why, exactly, he’s formally staying in the Democratic primary race that he’s lost to Hillary Clinton.But its the one thing he’s been bleeding every day ever since he dropped California’s primary by a much wider-than-expected margin last week. Sanders’ summer was supposed to be all about building leverage for the Democratic convention, providing him with a better hand to play as he presses Clinton to accept his policy positions and party reform suggestions. Now, the people closest to him aren’t sure how exactly to get it back.His first and most prominent endorsers have jumped off the bandwagon, congratulating and in some cases endorsing Clinton — from Sen. Jeff Merkley to Rep. Raul Grijalva, and from the Communications Workers of America to MoveOn.org.Each of the big-name Democrats and groups who steadfastly remained neutral in the primary have flocked to Clinton over the past week, from President Barack Obama to Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the AFL-CIO. Even Sanders highest-profile congressional endorsee, Nevada’s Lucy Flores, lost her primary bid on Tuesday despite his cash injection into her campaign.Yet on Thursday night, speaking to over 200,000 viewers who tuned into his live-streamed video address, Sanders vowed to press on — pledging to fight to defeat Donald Trump but refusing to formally back Clinton and insisting his army of supporters isn’t going anywhere.We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become, he said, nearly acknowledging defeat but making a point not to concede while reading from a prompter in a cramped television studio deep in his hometown. And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.Speaking for 23 minutes, the Vermont senator rattled off a long list of policy stances and political changes he wants to push for the future of the party, each of which would need Clinton’s imprimatur to become reality -- from new leadership for the Democratic National Committee to a $15 federal minimum wage.If Democrats were expecting a less combative Sanders to formally exit the race on Thursday, it was a misunderstanding of his posture. His staffers believe that continuing to pull Clinton and the party to the left is only achievable as long as Sanders is still formally a candidate with a considerable number of delegates behind him at the July convention.And while his team has started signaling that it’s reached a new phase, it’s still far from sounding a truly conciliatory tone.We would like to get to a place where we could very actively support the nominee, campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Bloomberg Television on Thursday — a hope-filled line for Clinton’s team that nonetheless implied there was still considerable work to be done before true unity is achieved.To Sanders’ most steadfast remaining supporters, anything short of a continued campaign to tug Clinton on specific points — from embracing a nationwide ban on fracking to axing the superdelegate system — would be an abandonment of his political revolution.Bernie Sanders has brought a lot of new people into the Democratic fold, and I think it would be wise for Secretary Clinton to keep them close to the Democratic Party and close to her, said Utah Democratic Party chairman Peter Corroon, one of the superdelegates who remains with Sanders. His leverage comes from his supporters, and so while the prospects [of a victory] at the convention may be lower, I think there’s a whole group of people that Secretary Clinton needs to pay attention to. And if Senator Sanders is asking for something that will help keep them in the fold, then she should listen.We look forward to the Democratic Party embracing key aspects of his platform, added Anna Galland, the executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action — a group that backed Sanders before congratulating Clinton on her victory on Wednesday. We look forward to his historic campaign influencing the convention and how the Democratic Party acts moving forward.Sanders’ evening comments came while his team continues talks with Clinton’s aides about policies they’re looking to see on the party platform or in the front-runner’s agenda moving forward, and just two days after Clinton and Sanders sat down with their senior aides in Washington to talk in person for the first time in months.While they spoke for well over an hour and a half — longer than campaign officials initially expected — and issued nearly identical statements after the meeting, their Tuesday evening talk subtly indicated significant distance.Clinton, for example, noted that the two had discussed unifying the party — a phrase that was glaringly omitted from Sanders’ version. And the section of his statement where his team ran through the issues discussed by the candidates included a reference to making healthcare universal and accessible, a tense point of disagreement between the two that wasn’t included in the presumptive nominees statement.What’s unclear now is just how far Sanders can push Clinton, whose campaign is coming off one of its strongest stretches yet, and who has fully pivoted to taking on Trump with a series of speeches and an ad barrage that the real estate developer shows no signs of being able to match.Far from just leading Trump in national polls, Clinton’s allies now note that battleground state surveys also suggest she has little reason to fear that tepid support from Sanders backers could doom her.She has, nonetheless, started to show a willingness to tack left toward Sanders, scheduling an economic policy speech set for Ohio next week that could include nods to his agenda. On Thursday, the Clinton campaign also installed a new chief of staff at the DNC who comes from the Service Employees International Union — a labor pick that could be welcome to Sanders’ rank-and-file supporters.Still, the preliminary nature of those steps has not slowed the stream of ardent Sanders backers rallying to Clinton’s side in recent days. The loss of Merkley — his lone Senate endorser — and Grijalva — his first House supporter — were especially stinging, as was the immediate Clinton endorsement from liberal hero Warren.Such officials are seeing the handwriting on the wall as others are, acknowledged Corroon, noting that he hasn’t heard from Clinton’s team since she claimed the nomination. I think they probably should have waited ’til all the caucuses and primaries were over before saying anything.But now that they’re over, he said, things aren’t looking as positive as some had hoped.                 A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday. O’Brien is a late-night comic. He is also an observer of life in these United States. It is sometimes hard to observe that life and still remain a comic, and I admire him for trying.I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think, he said, his voice growing angrier as he spoke. However, I am the father of two, and I like to believe I have a shred of common sense, and I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semi-automatic assault rifle. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life.I do not know what the answer is, but I wanted to take just a moment here tonight to agree with the rapidly growing sentiment in America that it’s time to grow up and figure this out.Time to grow up. A fine idea. And I really wish the sentiment behind it was rapidly growing. Because not everybody in America will get a chance to grow up. Some of those children we send each morning to the safety of their schools will never make it back home alive. (According to the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, Since 2013, there have been at least 188 school shootings in America, an average of nearly one a week.)On Capitol Hill on Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for a ritual moment of silence in the House chamber to commemorate those killed in Orlando.Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes stood up and walked off the floor instead. Previously, he had tweeted:I will not attend one more ‘Moment of Silence’ on the Floor. Our silence does not honor the victims, it mocks them.The Moments of Silence in the House have become an abomination. God will ask you, ‘How did you keep my children safe’? Silence.If God is an angry God, prepare to know a hell well beyond that lived day to day by the families of the butchered. I will not be silent.’And I, for one, hope he keeps talking, tweeting, speaking out and walking out.Roger Simon is POLITICOs chief political columnist.                 A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday.

Math beats mouth.Donald Trump plans to defeat Hillary Clinton through blustery force of will and word — but the architect of Ted Cruz’s efficient, numbers-focused campaign thinks Trump is making a huge mistake by burning the modern electoral playbook. Jeff Roe, a burly and self-deprecating 43-year-old former baseball umpire and onetime howitzer-crew hand, estimates that the presumptive Republican nominee is costing himself from 2.5 to 5.5 percentage points nationally by refusing to invest more time, energy and cash in data, analytics and a first-rate ground operation.By any calculation those are precious points that Trump, who faces an uphill climb against Hillary Clinton on the electoral map — and has trailed the Democratic nominee in most polls — can’t afford to lose. He dumped our ass, right? He won, we lost, so lets keep everything in perspective, Roe told me during a 90-minute interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast that quickly turned into an intense tutorial in Republican campaign strategy and management — and a warning to the man who beat his boss.(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Theres a trove of information thats done in and around politics that Trump needs to tap, said Roe, who credits Cruz’s big win in the Iowa caucuses to the campaign’s identification and targeting of precisely 9,181 voters who were undecided but had Cruz and Trump as their final choices.It’s worth, on its worst day, 2½ points, and in its best day, 5½ points, he added. So let’s just split the difference and say that Clinton’s running a great [operation]. ... He’s not right now, so that would give her ... 3½ points.In May, Trump, who has the smallest and least experienced staff of any recent presidential campaign, told The Associated Press he thought President Barack Obama’s vaunted get-out-the-vote machine was a chimera, and that Obama really won on account of his own personal popularity, Trump-style.I’ve always felt it was overrated, Trump said, using language that conjured up images of green-eyeshade clerks feeding punch cards into 1970s computers. Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.In the absence of his own operation — or even an understanding of how the increasingly sophisticated system of identifying voters through their purchases, political activities and other demographic information works — Trump is relying on the Republican National Committee’s relatively modest voter outreach department.Big, big mistake, Roe told me. I don’t know everything that he has, but I do know a couple of things, he said. It’s going to be very hard for him to just use the RNC. The RNC has got a very candidate-generic model. ... [In Iowa,] we knew voters’ names and what they cared about and how they received their information.Roe is still close to Cruz and says his boss, like Obama, gobbles political intelligence and data like a professional, with insights candidates of previous eras (and Trump is nothing if not stubbornly retro) lacked.Over the next few weeks Cruz’s team, still largely intact, will conduct an autopsy of the campaign from a data and messaging standpoint and dial-test Cruz’s greatest hits and lowest moments with voter focus groups. The goal is to figure out a path forward, which quite possibly involves a second shot at the big prize in 2020, and Roe thinks Trump, win or lose in 2016, won’t be on the ballot four years from now.If Trump wins, I can’t imagine that he’d be in a reelect, right? he asked. He’s already reached the mountain. You don’t climb Kilimanjaro twice if you’re him. Cruz, conspicuously, remains the biggest GOP name not to endorse Trump. The reason, Roe said, is partly Trump’s decision to go very personal on the senator’s family, but also a professional calculation (with overtones of sweet revenge): Despite Trump’s claim that he’ll bring new independents into the process, 2016 promises to be the same-old base election and he’ll need the hard-core conservatives Lyin’ Ted was so good at galvanizing.Is it possible Cruz won’t endorse?Gosh. Yeah. Yeah, for sure, thats possible, said Roe, adding that he’s had only sporadic contact with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, talking or texting a half-dozen times since Cruz suspended his campaign a month back. I mean, if you learn anything from The Art of the Deal, [it] is you have leverage, you have something that somebody wants. Don’t ever act like you want to make a deal until you make a deal, OK? Then he smiled and eased back in his chair. Trump told Ted, ‘I dont need his votes,’ Roe said, with relish. OK? So that’s one way to look at it. If, at some point in the campaign, he believes he needs the votes and he believes that [they’re] key to him winning, then the conservatives will have leverage, and I think thats really damn important leverage. ... [We’ll be] able to hold him accountable.He refused to say whether Trump has asked Cruz to climb on board yet.Roe says Cruz’s surprising success was the candidate’s doing and not that of his 150-person Houston-based staff. But Republicans on opposing campaigns credit Roe’s stewardship, including an intense focus on metrics found more often in Democratic campaigns, for the Texas senator’s tempered triumph. (Jeff’s pretty good. Cruz won what — nine states? — and everybody thinks he’s the Zodiac [killer], said one former opponent, referencing an online joke that dogged Cruz during the campaign.)It’s not surprising that Roe, who shares his boss’s conservative social views as well as his delight in torturing more moderate Hill Republicans, doesn’t think much of Clinton’s policy positions or her personal political skills. But he’s a fan of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 operations and thinks Trump would be wise to notice the plodding but effective ground campaign she waged against Bernie Sanders.From an Xs-and-Os [perspective]… through a nonpartisan lens, they clearly have that part of their game buttoned up, he said of Clinton’s Brooklyn-based operation, overseen by campaign manager Robbie Mook and an analytics and organizing team that includes many former Obama operatives.Theyre not crushing fundraising, but theyre raising good money. Theyre not crushing ground, but theyre doing it really smart and effective. ... [Clinton voters] have little energy, but they’re overperforming their election night numbers routinely. That tells me that they know what they’re doing on the ground.Roe, who came up in the sharp-elbowed world of Missouri politics and has been known for his own stiletto tactics, offered a few lacerating comments about both major party candidates and their stratospheric disapproval ratings. The irony, he said with a chuckle, is that these people found the only person in the other party they could beat.Even though he dismisses the complaint that Cruz, who buddied up to Trump in early debates, waited too long to pounce, he acknowledges that the crowded field denied the Texas senator the chance to go one-on-one with the reality star.And he thinks that’s the key to beating him.Trump won, in part, because the pack was divided and because Cruz failed to move Marco Rubio and John Kasich aside quickly enough. Yeah, we could take him [mano a mano], yeah, no doubt, Roe told me.In a general election, Trump no longer enjoys the safety of the GOP herd. And with Sanders sliding offstage, Clinton has begun focusing her attacks exclusively on the real-estate mogul, something that didn’t happen until relatively late in the Republican primaries. Taking on Trump is smart, Roe said of her decision to hit the GOP nominee before decisively defeating Sanders in California earlier this month. It will be the thing that saves her.When Cruz finally got tough, Trump began dodging debates — and Roe predicted he’ll soon find an excuse to limit his onstage interactions with Clinton despite the widespread view that Trump’s attacks will make Clinton look weak and beatable.I dont know that theyll have one. ... I bet if they do, they only have one, he said of potential debates. Everybody’s going to bake it into the cake that she’s going to win, and he’s going to look like a fool and say the same things over and over. She will have the apparatus to have the time to prepare. Trump’s his own guy. He’ll be tired.I’m sure he’s going to do one, and he’ll call it a draw. He’ll win the Drudge poll afterwards, Roe added.

People wait for the start of a memorial service on June 19, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.   GettySupport for stronger gun control measures increased by 9 percentage points in recent days, after 49 people were killed inside an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, according to the results of a new CNN/ORC poll released Monday.The poll found 55 percent of Americans are in favor of stricter gun laws, with 42 percent opposed, which matches the highest level of support since the poll was taken in January 2013, just one month after Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. When the question was last asked in October 2015, 46 percent said they were in favor with 52 percent opposed.Further, 58 percent of respondents said they disapprove of how President Barack Obama is handling gun policy, compared with 36 percent who approve. When asked about specific policy steps, 92 percent of respondents favored expanded background checks, 87 percent supported prohibiting convicted felons or people with mental health problems from buying guns and 85 percent were in support of banning people on the terror watch list or on the no-fly list from buying guns. Only 9 percent of those surveyed supported preventing all Americans from owning guns. When it comes to banning the manufacture and sale of semi-automatic assault rifles, 54 percent said they were in favor, while 44 percent were opposed, virtually unchanged from the previous survey.The poll results come just before the Senate is set to vote on four gun control bills, all of which are expected to fail along party lines.The poll surveyed 1,001 adults between June 16 and June 19 via landlines and cellphones. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.                 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — while supportive of the assault weapons ban — has focused more on the No fly, no buy gun provision.  GettyA group of liberal House Democrats are calling on Speaker Paul Ryan to hold a vote on an assault weapons ban before Congress adjourns for the summer recess, according to a letter being circulated among lawmakers.The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes 75 House Democrats, wants Ryan to postpone the seven-week House recess that begins July 15 unless there is a vote on the measure. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other senior Democrats — while supportive of the assault weapons ban — have focused more on the No fly, no buy gun provision, as well as expanded background checks for gun sales. Senate Democratic leaders have also adopted the same strategy as that chamber prepares for four gun-related votes on Monday.But progressive Democrats in both the House and Senate want to go even further. Noting that Orlando gunman Omar Mateen used an assault weapon — a Sig Sauer MCX rifle — to kill 49 people and wound 53 more in the June 11 massacre, these lawmakers say more needs to be done. They are seeking a vote on Rep. David Cicillines (D-R.I.) proposed ban on assault weapons. Cicilline introduced the bill in December, and it currently has 139 co-sponsors. With this in mind, we write today to strongly urge you to hold the House of Representatives in session until we take up the Assault Weapons Ban of 2015, the Democratic letter states, according to a copy obtained by POLITICO.  It is well past time for Congress to take action to protect the American people. Our constituents strongly support substantive reforms to reduce gun violence, and they are demanding we take steps to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring these weapons of war.The letter adds: We must use every tool available to address the epidemic of gun violence in the United States, and we must start by acting to take assault weapons off of our streets. We have the responsibility to protect the American people from dangerous individuals with military-style assault weapons. For these reasons, we urge you to hold the House of Representatives in session until we consider the Assault Weapons Ban of 2015.Ryans office had no comment on the Progressive Caucus letter, which has not formally been sent to the speaker yet.                 Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said.  AP PhotoRepublicans on Monday assailed the Justice Departments decision to redact the Orlando shooters declaration of allegiance to the Islamic State in transcripts of 911 calls from the June 12 shooting as another example of not focusing on the evil here, as Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.After the unredacted version was released later in the day, Ryan said he was glad about the reversal but that this should have never been an issue in the first place. The attempt to selectively edit the record reflects a broader, more serious problem: this administration’s continued effort to downplay and distract from the threat of radical Islamist extremism, Ryan said in the later statement. This is unacceptable. To defeat terrorism we have to be clear-eyed about whom we’re fighting.This is evil, this is ISIS. Its radical Islam. At some point, we lost 49 lives here and we lost a journalist who was beheaded by ISIS, Scott told Fox News Bill Hemmer on Americas Newsroom, referring to the shooting last Sunday and the 2014 beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, who was from Florida. We need a president that’s going to say I care about destroying ISIS.Attorney General Loretta Lynch reasoned to CNN Sunday that the reason for the edits is to avoid re-victimizing those people that went through this horror, adding that it will contain the substance of his conversations. The FBI used similar language at a Monday news conference to explain its reasoning.I have no idea what she means, Scott said. But I can tell you what: I have gone to funerals, Ive sat down and cried with the parents. Ive gone and visited individuals in the hospitals. They are grieving. Now, they want answers. If it was my family I would want answers. We all would like answers. She should release everything that doesnt impact the investigation. I can understand if it impacted the investigation until this is finished, I get that. But she is not saying that. It doesnt make any sense to me. We have to get serious about destroying ISIS.The federal governments decision did not sit well with other Fox News guests on Monday morning, either.That would mean during the Second World War if I called up and said I am part of the Nazi movement, Ive joined here in the United States, and Im going kill 49 Americans and we left out Nazi movement, Rudy Giuliani said Monday on Fox & Friends.The redactions represent a degree of denial for the United States, Giuliani said, adding that it helps to cause the terrorists to be encouraged to commit more attacks.For Richard Grenell, who served in the George W. Bush administration as a spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , the decision to censor the words has policy implications and is not just a simple wording issue.The fact that Loretta Lynch is somehow redacting the enemy, the specific enemy that is being called out here is really a PR move, said Grenell. You only redact information when it reveals sources and methods, our intelligence-gathering techniques that we don’t want out there. That is the only reason. We have the same problem in the Hillary emails, where they’re redacting information for PR purposes.Later in the show, during Giulianis interview, co-host Steve Doocy commented, But, mayor, if you remove all references to radical Islam, you are removing the motive.Uh, yeah. Yeah, said Giuliani, who was a federal prosecutor before he became New York mayor.  I mean if I did that in court as a prosecutor my boss would fire me. The jury wants to know the motive for the crime. The killer has told us the motive for his crime. It would be like removing -- Im killing my friend because he cheated me out of money.The same principle applies for the Mafia, Giuliani remarked, alluding to his work indicting members of New Yorks Five Families. If you didnt see the connection between Italian-Americans and the Mafia, he said, you never could have brought them down.Asked about Donald Trumps recent comments in which he suggested that he would consider profiling individuals to prevent future acts of terrorism, Giuliani responded, We always profile.When I was police commissioner, involved in police work, assistant U.S. attorney, you call me up, you tell me a 6-foot-2 white man with blond hair and blue eyes was the killer, I profile white men with blue eyes and I go look for them, Giuliani said. You give me a larger number of people like that who are doing it, and I start to wonder: Are they part of a group? Could the Ku Klux Klan be in New York? So, then I profile the Ku Klux Klan. Of course you profile. Thats what policing is all about. Here’s where it’s wrong: it’s when you do it based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, just for that reason, just because you don’t like them. But [its good] if youre doing it based on hard facts that lead to protection of the public like a group of one type.                 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) earlier Monday issued a sarcastic statement mocking the deletions.  GettyThe FBI reversed itself and publicly issued a complete transcript of a 911 call from the Orlando nightclub shooter Monday afternoon after coming under withering criticism from House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans for deleting references to the Islamic State group as well as the groups leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.A version of the text of the 50-second call between an Orlando 911 dispatcher and shooter Omar Mateen disclosed Monday morning, included his claim of responsibility for the shooting, but was edited to remove Mateens mention of ISIL and of Al-Baghdadi.The FBI said the redactions were intended to limit any publicity benefit for ISIL, but House Speaker Paul Ryan sharply rejected that rationale and called on President Barack Obama to reverse the decision.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community, Ryan said. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.Hours later, the FBI did just that, saying that the deletions had caused an unnecessary distraction.The purpose of releasing the partial transcript of the shooters interaction with 911 operators was to provide transparency, while remaining sensitive to the interests of the surviving victims, their families, and the integrity of the ongoing investigation. We also did not want to provide the killer or terrorist organizations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda, the FBI and the Justice Department said in a joint statement emailed to reporters.Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime, the statement said.The FBI and Justice Department also noted that Mateens pledge of allegiance to ISIL had been previously reported, although those reports generally cited anonymous law enforcement sources.The reversal appeared to be an effort by the Justice Department and FBI to avoid fueling a longrunning debate about whether the administration has been unwilling to recognize the threat posed by radical Islam and is too politically correct in its public statements to avoid offending Muslims.Obama has said the administration fully understands the threat, but uses language intended to avoid alienating vast numbers of Muslims who harbor no hostility towards the U.S. Hes also said that attributing the attacks to radical Islam, would accomplish nothing.The more detailed transcript offers little insight into Mateens detailed motivations beyond his clear pledge of loyalty to ISIL and Al-Baghdadi. The shooter also uttered some common Arabic prayers.Asked his name, Mateen replied: My name is I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State.Again asked to identify himself, Mateen did not give his name, but said: I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi may God protect him [Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State.While the Obama administration has stressed that the attack appears to have been a hate crime targeted at the LGBT community and the popular gay nightclub, Mateen made no mention of any issues related to sexual orientation.Following Ryans comment, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) issued a sarcastic statement mocking the deletions and linking that decision to the administrations broader policy.The Obama Administration just redacted the [blank] out of the Orlando shooter’s 911 transcripts. I am greatly [blank] at the Administration’s denial of reality. How in the [blank] does censoring this [blank] make us [blank]?  McCaul said. This is in line with the Administration’s long string of [blank] of the threat Islamist terror poses to our homeland. The victims and their loved ones deserve justice, and the American people deserve all the facts. The terror threat to our nation cannot be redacted.An addendum to McCauls statement restored the deletions.In addition to removing the ISIL and Al-Baghdadi references, the initial FBI transcript referred to Mateen only by his initials. The newly-issued transcript gives his first and last names, which authorities publicly confirmed more than a week ago.The FBI and local police are still withholding recordings of all 911 calls and radio traffic, as well as transcripts of calls made by victims and people other than Mateen.Redactions have been made to avoid re-victimizing those who were in the Pulse nightclub, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Lee Bentley said. We wanted to release the transcripts at this time so the public would have a better idea of the timeline.Matthew Dixon and Nick Gass contributed to this report.                 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook slammed Donald Trump and his economic proposals.  GettyDonald Trump’s economic policies wouldn’t just move the U.S. backward; they would drive the country into an economic ice age, according to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook slammed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s economic proposals, adding that in addition to being unfit for the White House, the billionaire is also an economic threat.Mook argued that Trump’s tax plan would increase the national debt by more than $30 trillion over two decades and blasted him for suggesting that his administration would allow the U.S. to default on its debt, which would literally cause a global economic catastrophe far worse than anything we saw in 2008, he said.And, you know, we’ve seen what he’s done in his own business endeavors, where he has no problem defaulting on debt, Mook told SiriusXM’s The Agenda hosted by Ar Rabin-Havt, according to an early excerpt of the interview, which will air in full on Tuesday. He has no problem bankrupting his companies. So this is a real threat, and then look — his tax plan is gonna benefit people like him.A Moody’s Analytics analysis on Trump’s economic policies released Monday found that the real estate mogul’s plans — taken at face value — would significantly weaken the country, causing a lengthy recession with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate. The report also determined that Trump’s proposals would largely benefit very high-income households. Mook also said that Trump would abandon reforms in Dodd-Frank, legislation enacted to prevent another financial crisis in the wake of what transpired in 2008, start trade wars overseas and take America backward on immigration reform.When you bundle all this together, you know, he would send us into an economic ice age, Mook said.Mark Zandi, a chief economist at Moody’s Analytics and lead author of the report, is a former John McCain adviser and Clinton donor. A Federal Election Commission report shows he donated the maximum $2,700 to Clinton’s primary campaign last June.                 Apple CEO Tim Cook will hold a fundraiser with Speaker Paul Ryan, after Apple said they would not be participating in this years Republican National Convention.  GettyApple CEO Tim Cook will host a fundraiser with House Speaker Paul Ryan next week as the iPhone maker tries to strengthen its relationships with key Republicans — despite its decision to pull support for the GOP convention because of its distaste for Donald Trump.Cook will help generate cash for Ryan at a private breakfast on June 28 in Menlo Park, Calif., along with Gary Wipfler, the company’s treasurer, according to an invite obtained by POLITICO on Monday. The money benefits not only the speaker but a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans.Cook is hosting the fundraiser on his own accord, as Apple does not have a corporate political action committee like Facebook, Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley. Still, the move reflects Apple’s desire to court Republican and Democratic officeholders alike, even at a time when it has serious reservations about Trump, the GOPs presumptive presidential nominee.Trumps incendiary remarks about women, immigrants and minorities led Apple to decide against donating cash and technology to the GOPs convention in Cleveland next month, according to two sources, who revealed the company’s thinking to POLITICO on Saturday. Apple had provided such aid to Democratic and Republican nominating events in previous years.A company spokesman declined to comment for this story.The Trump campaign has not commented on Apples convention decision, which marks a break with other tech giants, like Facebook and Google, which have said they will provide support to the Republican nominating event this year. Trump has taken repeated shots at Apple and Cook, even calling for a boycott of the companys products over its stance on encryption.Trump aside, Cook long has sought to improve his company’s relationships with Democrats and Republicans — a far different approach than that of Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who disdained Washington.Cook donated to Barack Obama during his first White House run. In 2015, he donated cash to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a vocal Apple ally during the company’s fight with the government over the way it priced its e-books. That same year, the Apple CEO wrote a personal check to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who shares the iPhone maker’s views on surveillance reform. And in 2016, Cook backed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a leading tech policy advocate who represents a slice of the Bay Area.On the Republican side, Cook has been just as active. When the Apple CEO visited Washington in May 2015, he huddled with leading Republicans, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), to talk patent reform and other issues. In August, Cook hosted a fundraiser for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a major ally in the company’s calls for tax reform, in Atherton, Calif., according to an invite obtained by POLITICO. From a border wall with Mexico to a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to a warmer embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, Vice President Joe Biden sees Donald Trump’s foreign policy as problematic at best and damaging at worst.The vice president said as much Monday afternoon in a speech to the Center for New American Security’s Annual Conference in downtown Washington, excerpts of which were released Monday morning. Biden drew a contrast between the progress he said he and President Barack Obama have made over the last seven years and Trump’s proposals, which the vice president painted as backwards-facing.But if we turn inward, undermine our most important relationships, or seek sound bite solutions in a world defined by complexity, Biden said. If we forget who we are, betray our values, and embrace intolerance. We will squander all of our hard-earned progress.Biden said building a border wall would disrespect our neighbors and heighten anti-American feelings in the Western hemisphere. Listing global challenges like climate change, radicalism, and health epidemics, Biden said, no matter what others may claim, we cannot wall ourselves off from these challenges.On China, a nation with which Trump said the U.S. makes bad deals, Biden will say cooperation is essential and to resort to confrontation would make life harder for billions of people. The vice president bragged about his close working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and spoke of private working dinners with Xi during which Biden asserted Americas role as a Pacific power and suggested China has been a beneficiary of Americas presence in the region.Biden also defended as essential the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal of the variety that Trump has regularly bashed on the campaign trail. Deepening ties economic ties in the Pacific is crucial, Biden said, to an array of American interests.It is as much a foreign policy initiative as it is an economic initiative as it is an economic initiative, Biden said of the controversial trade deal. We’re not there, China will fill the vacuum, just by the sheer weight and size. And it will not be in our interest.Biden had especially harsh words for Trump’s terrorism policy proposals and his plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. He characterized the GOP nominees campaign as wielding the politics of fear and intolerance and mirrored Obama’s refrain that the U.S. must be careful not to disaffect the world’s Muslims while combating extremism.There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world. Some of the rhetoric I’m hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion, Biden said. How do we win this? How do we win this long term fight without embracing, engaging and having allies in the Islamic community in the United States, among American citizens and immigrants? How do we do this without allies in the Muslim world?Alienating 1.5 billion Muslims, the vast, vast majority of whom, at home and abroad, are peace-loving, it doesn’t make the situation better. It makes it worse. And it plays into the very narrative of the extremists, Biden said, using an alternate estimation of the number of Muslims in the world. Why in God’s name are we giving them what they want? And besides, we are so much better than that. Whether its Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, the next president will need to deal with setting aside defense cuts as part of sequestration, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday, though he gave an indication as to which gender he expects the 45th commander in chief to be.The next president, whoever he or she — most likely she — is going to be, needs to get these defense cuts set aside, Graham remarked during a discussion at the Center for a New American Securitys conference.Graham also took a shot at Trump, his former presidential primary rival, in discussing the spectrum of Republican viewpoints on defense. The bottom line: I think there’s a fight within the Republican Party for who we are on foreign policy, from the Rand Paul view to the Lindsey Graham, John McCain view, Graham said. And Trump’s somewhere out there, somewhere saying something, I don’t know where he’s at. So, so, I think there’s a more traditional view of foreign policy emerging on the Republican side. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to run for president.Graham has been one of the most vocal critics of Trumps candidacy, most recently urging his fellow Republicans to un-endorse their partys presumptive nominee after his comments attacking a federal judge.There will be a desire by all of us to help the next president, whoever he or she may be, Graham said. And I would advise the next president, if it’s Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, to start — give [Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.)] and me and other people a call about rebuilding the Defense Department, setting aside sequestration. I may be wrong, but I think there’d be a pretty large audience for that.                 Priorities USA Action - a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC - is targeting Donald Trump in battleground states.  GettyThe main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign had its biggest month of 2016 in May, bringing in $12.1 million — $3.5 million more than the previous month — as the now-presumptive Democratic nominee neared the nomination in her primary battle against Bernie Sanders and started taking on Donald Trump.Priorities USA Action started June sitting on roughly $52 million in cash on hand after bringing in roughly $88 million, with commitments of another $45 million, for the election cycle, the group told POLITICO on Monday.May’s haul — led by $3 million from Chicago media executive Fred Eychaner — comes as the group is engaged in a major anti-Trump ad onslaught in eight battleground states that’s expected to last until election day: it has reserved roughly $147 million between television, radio, and digital platforms. Looking to project an aggressive posture against the presumptive GOP nominee, it added North Carolina — a state Barack Obama won in 2008 but not 2012 — to its buys earlier this month, expanding its list from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Virginia.In the last few weeks Donald Trump accused President Obama of working with ISIS, took a victory lap following a national tragedy, and mimed shooting someone at one of his events, said Priorities’ chief strategist, Guy Cecil. Priorities USA is not going to let this man anywhere near the White House because he is far too dangerous and divisive to ever be President of the United States. We will not let up in our efforts to defeat him this November, and are grateful for our continued fundraising success.The group’s television ads have thus far sought to paint Trump as divisive and dangerous, pointing out his harsh rhetoric about women and zeroing in on his mocking of a reporter’s disabilities by featuring an Ohio couple whose daughter has spina bifida. A new spot released on Sunday describes him as too dangerous for America, quoting him on foreign policy.Clinton’s campaign has also started bombarding the real estate developer with ads in the same eight swing states, but Trump has thus far not responded in kind — and the constellation of super PACs surrounding Trump have yet to make significant moves either. Donald Trumps ousted campaign manager stayed loyal to his boss even after his firing Monday, as Corey Lewandowski did multiple cable TV interviews Monday in which he praised his boss, rejected reports of internal discord within the campaign and continued to project the campaigns message.I had a nice conversation with Mr. Trump and said to him, its been an honor and privilege to be part of this and I mean that for the bottom of my heart, Lewandowski told CNNs Dana Bash. I think as you look at how small this team has been and how close knit this team has been, its really important to know there are highs and lows in every campaign and weve been through them together and we need to continue with the [Republican National Committee] to utilize the resources they have available to us. Its been a great privilege, and look, I wouldnt change one second.Asked why he was fired, Lewandowski said that he did not know.One of the raps on you is that you fed his worst instincts, Bash said. Anybody who knows me and has known me over a long period of time knows Im a very straight shooter, Lewandowski replied, calling it a characteristic that has worked to his own detriment on many occasions.I tell people the way it is, whether it’s good or bad or indifferent. Because I always say Im not smart enough to lie, ‘cause I cant remember the lie I told. So what I say is I give you my best opinion and recommendation. That my duty and obligation to anybody I work for, whether it’s Mr. Trump or a different company, he continued. All I can do is give my best advice and counsel. Doesn’t mean it’s right, doesn’t mean it’s wrong. But I’m going to give you my best advice and if my best advice is something you agree with, great. And if you disagree, thats OK, too. And we have had many conversations where Mr. Trump and I have either agreed or disagreed but at the end of the day, I dont take it personally. I just give my best advice, and that’s the job of any good staffer.As far as whether he felt surprised or blindsided by the decision, Lewandowski demurred.I dont know if its so much of that. Its been a lot of conjecture in the media lately about whats going on well and what isnt going on well in the campaign, Lewandowski told CNN. I think a lot of that is just the media trying to hype up a campaign, he said in reference to Hillary Clinton.Trump does not get proper attention or credit, Lewandowski suggested. Even when he gives a great policy speech, hes probably the best speaker that our country has ever seen for a presidential candidate, the ousted manager said.I think what you have is an opportunity to expand. Mr. Trump brought millions of people into the Republican Party. We see independents who haven’t voted in 20 or 30 years coming out, massive rallies, crowds, Lewandowski said in an interview aired on MSNBC.Look, those people are so energized. So I think it’s very important. But what are you going up against now is a Hillary Clinton machine, it’s four more years of Obama administration. They’ve got a massive operation, they’ve got, you know, I think she’s raised $800 million so far. Theyre going to have all the resources in the world to go and talk about the liberal agenda.Were you escorted out of the building by security today? Bash asked, to which the former campaign manager responded, It doesnt work like that. Obviously, there are protocols in place so when someone is no longer an employee, theres no escorting out. Look, Ive had the privilege of working with these people for 19 months. Theyre friends of mine but theres a protocol and everyone follows the same protocol regardless of who it is and I think thats the right thing.It wasnt security; it was a friend from the office, Lewandowski said.Asked about a tweet from Michael Caputo, Trumps New York state director, which alluded to his firing by comparing him to the Wicked Witch of the East, Lewandowski chalked it up to the nature of the campaign.Talk to the people who have been here from the beginning, he told CNN. The people who have been in the trenches, who understand and have seen Mr. Trumps work ethic and what hes been able to accomplish whether its new Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa, those states where no one gave him a chance and he became successful and became the Republican nominee. I think if you asked them, theyd stand toe to toe with me any day of the week and 20 hours a day to make sure that they had the same work ethic I do and I think thats what I try to foster with the people Ive worked with. On reports that Trumps family played a role in orchestrating his ouster, particularly Ivanka Trumps husband, Jared Kushner, Lewandowski was dubious to both MSNBC and CNN.I can say Ive had a great relationship with the family and I think I continue to do so, Lewandowski remarked too CNN. Look. Everybody has their own opinions and I think what you have is a transition in the campaign from a very, very successful 37-state primary victory process managed at a one-off level ... to look to a bigger picture. Thats okay. Theres nothing wrong with that. More ideas, people giving iput, thats great, important. Im an implementer. Thats what I try to do. Take the ideas laid out and implement them to the best of our ability and most important thing and that includes the kids input, other professionals input, it includes elected officials, it includes the D.C. peoples input. I try to implement what the collective organization is best for the campaign.On Kushner specifically, Lewandowski said he has had a great relationship, and Im not sure where thats coming from.Ivanka Trump? Bash asked. Great asset to the campaign, Lewandowski said.Bash followed up, Would you be surprised if you heard she was not thrilled with the job that you were doing?I dont think thats the case, Lewandowski said. I think Ivanka is somebody who understands her father and a fantastic surrogate for this campaign, she brings a sense of calmness to the campaign. She has a way about her that she connects immediately not just with women but with business executives. Shes so polished, so professional. Its been an honor to be able work with her for the last 18 months.Asked his biggest regret, Lewandowski was unequivocal: None professionally.None? Thats not even — I know that youre human, Bash said, touching Lewandowskis arm. Theres flesh and blood. Youve got to have some regrets.Overall, Lewandowski said his biggest regret was not being able to have my family more involved.My family lives in New Hampshire. Ive got four young children, he remarked. Campaigns are so all-consuming, theyre so time consuming, its difficult to go home and explain what your day was like.But that is not a regret at all, Lewandowski was quick to add.I have no regrets as it comes to this campaign. Ive been given such an opportunity and a privilege and if somebody said to me 18 months ago, youll be managing the candidate through 37 state victories, 14 million votes, more votes than anyone in the history of the Republican Party, I’d say, is that possible? Look what hes been able to achieve and Im a small part of that, Lewandowski said. So I have no regrets at all. Corey Lewandowski has been fired as Donald Trumps campaign manager, ending the tenure of the fiery operative who faced steady string of controversies while guiding Trumps skeleton campaign operation to a shocking victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign, spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The New York Times, which reported the news on Monday. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.A senior Trump aide confirms Lewandowski was fired by the campaign.On CNN Monday, Lewandowski told Dana Bash that he spoke with Trump personally in his firing — calling it a nice conversation — and said that he still supported Trump. He also said he did not know why hed been fired.Another source briefed on the departure said Trumps adult children have been pushing for Lewandowskis ouster since he was accused of assaulting then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Ivanka Trump, especially, was said to be concerned about the effect of Lewandowski on the Trump family brand. (Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks pushed back on the assertion that Trumps family influenced the decision.) It’s unclear when the decision came down, but it seems to have surprised Lewandowski and his allies in and around the campaign. One campaign official who was hired by Lewandowski said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss. It was a good chat, the official said.Still, the campaign that morning removed Lewandowski from a scheduled appearance on Fox News Sunday, instead dispatching prominent Trump backer Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.Another source, however, says the personal affinity between Lewandowski and Trump, built up over the year-long run to the top of the GOP, remains intact despite the firing.And in a statement Monday, Lewandowski reaffirmed his support for his now-former boss. I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hilary Clinton ever will be, he said.The now-former campaign manager had worked for Trumps campaign since it launched last June, but he had clashed with campaign chairman Paul Manafort since Manafort was brought on board this spring.The senior Trump aide said the decision to oust Lewandowski stemmed from necessity, faulting Lewandowski for not getting along with the Republican National Committee and for Trumps operation falling behind Hillary Clinton from an infrastructure perspective. There was recognition, the aide said, that Lewandowski was no longer up to the job. According to another source, Lewandowskis departure comes amid a sense of disorder within the campaign and Lewandowski taking much of the blame for it. The source said he was under fire for blocking hires, refusing to install more traditional elements of the campaign and generally causing friction.Lewandowskis critics openly celebrated his ouster.Michael Caputo, a Trump adviser and Manafort ally within the campaign, appears to have mocked Lewandowski on Twitter. He tweeted out a still image from the movie The Wizard of Oz showing the witch buried under Dorothys house and linking to a YouTube video featuring the Ding dong, the witch is dead song from the film.Jim Baker, who served as Trumps state director for multiple states before being fired by Lewandowski in May (some say for recognizing Manaforts authority above the campaign manager’s), texted Lewandowski a mocking job offer as soon as news of his firing broke. The offer: Hey bud, I see youre looking for work now - I may be willing to have you interview for a field rep position I have open in Binghamton. Baker now manages the congressional campaign of independent candidate Martin Babinec in New Yorks 22nd district. He said Lewandowski has not yet responded.With Lewandowski out, Manafort is the de facto head of the campaign, Trump adviser Barry Bennett said Monday on Fox News. But Bennett said the change at the top would not significantly alter Trumps strategy. I dont think well see dramatic changes, he said. I wouldnt call it a pivot, because that makes it sound like it’s a big move. The campaign has always been about the Mexican heroin problem and schools that dont work and government that is wasteful and people who cant find jobs and no one is getting a raise. That’s kind of things this campaign has been about over a year. We need to talk about that more for sure.Upon news of Lewandowskis departure, Fields, now a reporter for the Huffington Post, tweeted, Hey @CLewandowski_ I hear @BreitbartNews is hiringFields worked for Breitbart News until March, when she and the outlets editor-at-large left the company over how it handled an incident the previous week in Florida at which Lewandowski grabbed Fields arm to move her away from Trump as she tried to answer a question. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery but the state declined to prosecute.Ben Schreckinger, Ken Vogel, Patrick Reis and Shane Goldmacher contributed to this report.                 John Kerry said Donald Trumps ideas dont match the fundamental values of protecting people.  GettySecretary of State John Kerry tore into Donald Trump’s policy proposals on the commemoration of World Refugee Day, suggesting that the presumptive Republican nominees ideas deviate from the fundamental values of protecting people.But there is usually a very strong guideline with respect to fundamental values of dealing with refugees to fundamental values of protecting people. And, trying to make a difference and I think traditionally, Republican presidents, Democratic presidents alike have applied those standards, Kerry told a group of college students on Monday, without mentioning Trump by name. This is the first campaign that I can think of where there has been as a dramatic variant in some of the proposals, without getting specific.The White House also released a statement that took a veiled shot at Trumps rhetoric, which intensified last week after the June 12 shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Speaking to CBS Face the Nation in an interview aired Sunday, Trump said he hates the concept of profiling but would be willing to do so in response to recent terrorist attacks. Trump previously called on a temporary ban of all Muslim immigration, including from majority Muslim countries.We will continue to alleviate the suffering of refugees abroad, and to welcome them here at home, because doing so reflects our American values and our noblest traditions as a Nation, enriches our society, and strengthens our collective security, President Barack Obama said in a statement. Their lives and their many accomplishments stand as a clear rebuke to the bigotry and brutality they fled, and serve as a powerful example of the human will to endure, hope, and achieve. President Barack Obama endorsed LinkedIn as a job search tool Monday, joking that he would use the professional social media network to seek employment after he leaves the White House.America is an extraordinary place to do business, Obama said, after ticking through a list of facts that support that statement.As he frequently does when speaking to younger people, Obama made the case that if given the choice to live in any era — not knowing what your gender, ethnicity or class would be — you would choose right now.You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history, he said in his keynote address at the Washington Hilton for the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit. Less violent. Less driven by division. You’d choose today.Obama touted the country’s steady rate of private sector job growth, high school graduation rate, percentage of Americans insured under Obamacare, slow growth of health care costs and high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field.Our rule of law, our mature capital markets — all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business, Obama added. Now that’s a pretty good sales pitch. I don’t mind being America’s pitchman, and in seven months or so — in seven months or so, I’ll be on the job market, and I’m glad I’m gonna be here. I’m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.In February, the president posted on LinkedIn about his first summer job scooping ice cream to announce a summer job initiative for young people.My first summer job wasn’t exactly glamorous, but it taught me some valuable lessons. Responsibility. Hard work. Balancing a job with friends, family, and school, Obama wrote. We’re kicking off a Summer Opportunity Project that brings together state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses — including LinkedIn — to get young people into their first jobs and create strong transitions between school years and from high school to college and careers.                 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during a rally at Louisville Slugger Fields Hall of Fame Pavilion in Louisville, Ky., Tuesday, May 10.   AP PhotoHillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 7 percentage points, according to a new poll — one of the latest national surveys to show the presumptive Republican presidential nominee badly trailing his likely Democratic opponent.Clinton earned 47 percent support in the new Monmouth University poll released Monday, while Trump took 40 percent in a head-to-head matchup omitting third-party challengers. Another 5 percent said they would support another candidate, while 6 percent said they are undecided and 2 percent said who said they would not support anyone or declined to respond. And the numbers only get worse for Trump: Nearly six in 10 registered voters said that stopping him from getting elected president is important. And though nearly half said the same of Clinton, her advantage is undiminished when the survey sample narrows.Among voters who described themselves as likely, for instance, Clinton leads by eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent. And in the 10 states where the margin of victory in the 2012 presidential election was less than seven points, Clinton leads 47 percent to 39 percent.Monmouth conducted the poll from June 15-19, days after an Islamic State sympathizer slaughtered 49 and wounded dozens more at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump has responded to that attack by repeating his call to indefinitely ban Muslims from entering the United States, criticizing Clinton and President Barack Obama for their weak response to radical Islamist terrorism. Clinton has called for an intelligence surge and ripped Trumps comments as unpresidential.The Monmouth poll is only the latest in a series of recent national polls showing Trump trailing Clinton. A Bloomberg poll released last Tuesday showed Clinton with a 12-point lead of 49 percent to 37 percent, while Trump himself tweeted a poll last Friday showing him losing to Clinton by only two points. The RealClearPolitics national average shows Clinton ahead by nearly 6 percentage points — a gap that has only widened since late May.Trumps polling woes have added to a sense of siege inside his operation, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski ousted Monday morning after clashing with family members and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.In the Monmouth survey, Clinton leads Trump head-to-head with independents (42 percent to 37 percent), women, and people of all ages, between 18 and 34 (54 percent to 34 percent), 35 and 54 (47 percent to 39 percent) and leads within the margin of error among those 55 and older (44 percent to 43 percent). Trump leads among Republicans (84 percent to 8 percent) and in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 (50 percent to 37 percent).In a four-way matchup with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clintons lead over Trump narrows slightly, 42 percent to 36 percent. Johnson, meanwhile, earned 9 percent, Stein took 4 percent, with 2 percent saying they would support another candidate, 4 percent saying they are undecided among those candidates and 1 percent who said they would not support anyone or refused to respond. Among independents in a four-way race, Trump leads Clinton 32 percent to 31 percent, with Johnson pulling in 18 percent and Stein at 8 percent.Among registered voters, 49 percent overall said it is very important that Trump not become president, while another 10 percent called it somewhat important. On the other hand, 8 percent said it was not too important and 31 percent said it was not at all important. The results break down unsurprising partisan lines, with 89 percent of Democrats ascribing some degree of importance to denying Trump the White House and 76 percent of Republican registered voters who said the opposite. For Clinton, 41 percent said it is very important that she not become president, while 10 percent said it was somewhat important. Another 11 percent said it was not too important and 35 percent said it was not at all important. While 89 percent of Republicans said it was important for Clinton not to be president, 83 percent of Democrats said it was not important to some degree.Nearly seven in 10, or 69 percent, said they are certain about their vote in November, while 18 percent said they might change their mind and 13 percent said they are undecided.Less than one-third of registered voters said they have a favorable opinion of Trump, at just 28 percent to 57 percent unfavorable. Clinton did not fare much better, with 36 percent saying they have a favorable opinion of her and 52 percent who said they did not.Voters preferred Clinton over Trump on matters of the economy and jobs (47 percent to 44 percent) as well as on who they most trusted to handle the threat of terrorism on U.S. soil (46 percent to 44 percent).Asked whether they supported banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., similar to Trumps temporary ban, 70 percent said they were opposed and 21 percent said they would support.Trump tweaked his proposed Muslim ban last week to say that the U.S. needs to look at banning immigration from countries where there has been a history of anti-Western terrorism, though voters seemed reluctant to support that idea as well. While 34 percent said they would support such a measure, nearly six in 10, or 57 percent, opposed.Via landlines and cellphones, Monmouth surveyed 803 registered voters drawn from a list of registered voters and through random-digit dialing. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.                 The Democratic National Committee issued a statement blasting Donald Trump as the problem after he fired his campaign manager.  GettyDonald Trump may have fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday, but the Democratic National Committee suggested that the presumptive Republican nominee need only look in the mirror to find the person most responsible for his problems.Corey Lewandowski is not the problem, it’s Donald Trump, national press secretary Mark Paustenbach said in a statement, noting in particular the candidates call to temporarily ban Muslims from the country and his comments pertaining to a judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuits. It wasn’t Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was Donald Trump. It wasn’t Corey Lewandowski who disparaged a federal judge born in Indiana because his parents were ‘Mexican’, it was Donald Trump.News of Lewandowskis firing does nothing to make up for Trump’s divisive and racist comments and policies, Paustenbach concluded. It does reinforce, however, that there’s no one Trump won’t throw overboard for his own personal benefit, just as he’s done his entire life. Trumps campaign manager faced a series of controversies and internal campaign conflicts throughout the primary season even as the candidate racked up victory after victory. The FBI released a partial transcript on Monday of a 911 call terrorist Omar Mateen made from inside Orlando’s Pulse nightclub during his June 12 attack that killed 49 people, though it declined to release audio from the incident.The partial transcript is redacted to remove portions of Mateen’s pledges of allegiance to the Islamic State, a move intended to minimize the value of the calls as propaganda for the militant group. The FBI also did not release audio of the calls, which U.S. Attorney Lee Bentley said was meant to avoid revictimizing those who were inside the nightclub.Mateen identified himself as the gunman in his call to 911, according to the FBI transcript, and spoke in both Arabic and English. Twice asked for his name by the 911 operator, Mateen would only reply with his pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The name of the militant group was removed from the transcripts by the FBI.Part of the redacting is meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said at a news conference. We’re not going to propagate their rhetoric, their violent rhetoric, and we see no value in putting those individuals’ names back out there. We’re trying to prevent future acts from happening again and for cowards like this one, people like that influence them.Hopper confirmed that there is no indication that Mateen received direction for his attack from the Islamic State or any other terrorist group. Hopper was careful to differentiate between Islam and what he called the perverted view of the religion that inspired the Orlando gunman, hewing closely to similar language used by President Barack Obama to describe terrorist attacks.But House Speaker Paul Ryan objected to the redactions and called on the Department of Justice and the Obama administration to release the full transcripts.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS, Ryan said in a statement, referring to the Islamic State by another common name for the group. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript to the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.Hopper also described the shooter’s tone as chilling, calm and deliberate and said that although the audio was compelling, its release would be excruciatingly painful for victims.Bentley, Hopper and other law enforcement officials did not answer questions pertaining to the ongoing investigation into the shooting. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is scheduled to travel to Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday to receive an on-the-ground briefing from law enforcement on that investigation.                 Rep. Mo Brooks said Muslims would kill every homosexual in the country if they could.  GettyRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) on Thursday said that Muslims would kill every homosexual in the United States of America if they could, after suggesting that Democrats are trying to appeal to both the LGBT community and the Muslim community.On the one hand, they’re trying to appeal to the gay community, but, on the other hand, they’re trying to also appeal to the Muslim community, which, if it had its way, would kill every homosexual in the United States of America, the Republican lawmaker said while being interviewed on the Matt & Aunie show, a radio program on Birmingham, Alabamas Talk 99.5 FM, as first reported by BuzzFeed News. The statement came after Brooks was asked why Democrats fail to address mainstream Muslim thought that calls for the death of gay people, days after Omar Mateen opened fire at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people.Brooks also said, It’s pretty clear that the Islamic doctrine says that you are to kill homosexuals where you find them.

AP PhotoMinutes after news broke that Donald Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was no longer with the campaign, one of the presumptive Republican nominees top advisers and surrogates took to Twitter to celebrate.Ding dong the witch is dead, tweeted Michael Caputo, a senior adviser and the director of Trumps New York campaign, along with a photo of vanquished Wicked Witch of the East from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and a YouTube link to the song.Ding dong the witch is dead! https://t.co/pSqQwmAGz1 pic.twitter.com/5dE7GMeEK6— Michael Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) June 20, 2016Lewandowskis departure follows months of reported infighting in the campaign between his allies and those of campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Caputo is seen as a Manafort ally within the campaign.                 Republicans are hoping they will be celebrating like the Cleveland Cavaliers once the election is over.  GettyThe Republican National Committee is hoping the Cavaliers are not the only winners from Cleveland this summer.The partys Twitter account congratulated the Cavaliers on Twitter on Monday morning for winning the NBA championship over the Golden State Warriors and predicted more success from the city in the coming months. Congrats to the @cavs! This team is just the first winner Cleveland will produce this summer! it tweeted, in a message quickly retweeted by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.The Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland next month, where Donald Trump looks to officially win the nomination.The Cavaliers’ deep run in the playoffs, however, did pose a bit of a challenge for the GOP, which had to wait the maximum length of the series to begin setting up for the convention at the teams Quicken Loans Arena. As the Cavaliers kept winning, the Republican Party was unable to begin preparations for the convention, as The New York Times reported last Friday, a day after the teams final possible home game.                 AP PhotoThe Supreme Court will let stand bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York, laws passed in the wake of a 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.The court’s decision Monday to reject separate challenges to each state’s law leaves in place measures that ban weapons like the one used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children and six faculty members dead. Those laws also prohibit the sale of the type of gun used by terrorist Omar Mateen to kill 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.The June 12 terrorist attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub has prompted renewed calls for gun control legislation, but the debate has centered mostly on banning individuals on a terrorist no-fly list from purchasing weapons. The discussion has largely avoided calls for a fresh ban on assault weapons, which were banned for a decade and only became legal again in 2004. Connecticut and New York are two of seven states that ban assault weapons, along with the District of Columbia.The high court’s decisions not to hear the two cases, Shew v. Malloy for Connecticut and Kampfer v. Cuomo for New York, are the latest in a string of such rejections. The Supreme Court has not heard a case pertaining to second-amendment rights since 2010, when it overturned a Chicago law banning handguns.  Spurred by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, the Senate will vote Monday on a quartet of bills to prevent terrorists from buying weapons and overhaul the national background check system for firearms purchases.But the chamber’s big gun show on Monday is expected to be just that: political theater.All four proposals are reheated versions of legislation the Senate rejected in the past. Despite a flurry of negotiations over the past week, and some movement among centrist Republicans toward a compromise that continued over the weekend, there’s little indication the outcome will be any different this time.The Republicans have to look at themselves in the mirror and they have to look at their constituents in the eye this November, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said on a recent conference call with reporters. They hear the same messages we do from thousands and thousands of their constituents, just as we do from ours.The Senate will take a series of roll-call votes at 5:30 p.m. Monday.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are sponsoring different versions of legislation to flag suspected terrorists trying to buy guns and reform the background check system.But negotiations between party leaders on something that could actually pass with significant bipartisan support fell apart last week. The National Rifle Association backed a bill from GOP leaders that Democrats won’t accept. Democrats mounted a high-profile filibuster to press for more gun regulations — a deeply politicized response, in Republicans’ view.The uncertainty that remains is whether centrists in either party can craft a deal and sell it to their leaders — which aides on both sides of the aisle say is a long shot.Instead, Monday’s votes will be all about gaining political advantage in the November election and positioning each party for any effort to take up gun restrictions in 2017, when a group of red-state Democrats will be facing reelection the following year.But this fall, Democrats plan to accuse vulnerable Republicans of being more interested in doing the NRA’s bidding than making the country safe. Republicans counter that Democrats are the ones exploiting a tragedy, the killing of 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.The leader of the filibuster, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said the effort led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to draft a compromise bill on preventing potential terrorists from buying guns would not have happened without his nearly 15-hour speech.There is consensus here, Murphy said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. None of that would’ve been happening if we didn’t stand up and conduct that filibuster. We were just going to go on, like business as usual.But Republicans say Democrats have already gone too far by forcing GOP senators to vote against Democratic measures — and then, in all likelihood, turn the votes into fodder for ads against Republicans.I understand what Chuck Schumer’s motivation is, said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), whose efforts to find a middle ground were brusquely shrugged off by the same Democratic senators working to oust him from his Senate seat this fall.Behind the scenes, several Republicans are working with centrist Democrats on a compromise that could pass the Senate. Collins backs a bill that would create a narrow list of suspected terrorists who would be barred outright from buying firearms. Her measure would also set up a broader list of suspected terrorists that would be used to notify federal authorities if someone on the bigger list tried to purchase a gun.Those negotiations continued over the weekend, and even some conservatives seemed hopeful.Susan is so careful about those things and she’s worked really hard to figure out the differences in various lists and what kind of proof it takes to get on that list, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday. Some way we should be able to make this work.But Republican leaders have already allowed four votes on gun measures for Monday — that alone was a win for Democrats given the limited calendar time and proximity to the election. Republicans are growing tired of responding to the Democratic minority on an issue that could be troublesome for them in blue and purple states.Republicans would rather turn the scrutiny away from themselves and on to President Barack Obama, who they argue has failed to effectively respond to the Islamic State, the genesis of the terrorism threat against the United States.We’d like to actually talk about the real cause of that attack, and that is a terrorist attack on our own soil, and why the policies both in the Middle East and here at home are inadequate to deal with the threat of homegrown radicalization, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).The votes on Monday evening are likely to break on familiar partisan lines.The first two will focus broadly on background checks for gun sales. That issue stymied the Democratic-led Senate in 2013, which could not advance legislation just months after 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has a proposal meant to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System by boosting its funding and trying to make it easier for the system to gain records it doesn’t already have. The measure would also revise legal definitions on who is barred from owning a gun due to mental-health considerations.As a counter, Senate Democrats, led by Murphy, are pushing a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales by private sellers, including at gun shows and over the Internet. It’s similar to legislation written by Toomey with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that did not pass in 2013. The Democratic plan also has provisions to bolster the records kept by the background checks system.By making the bill different than the one supported by Toomey, a senior GOP aide argued the proposal is intentionally partisan. Toomey is likely to oppose Murphys background checks because it is more restrictive than the 2013 universal background checks bill. The final pair of votes is likely to get more attention in light of the Orlando shootings and the massacre in San Bernardino, California, which were both primarily carried out by U.S. citizens who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.The Democratic plan, written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), would allow the Justice Department to block sales of guns to people who are suspected of having terrorist ties. Republicans have said Feinstein’s proposal would intrude on the Second Amendment rights of those who are wrongly included on federal terror watch lists. Meanwhile, the GOP plan drafted by Cornyn would halt a sale only if a judge found probable cause that the person trying to buy the gun is involved in terrorist activities. Democrats say that burden of proof is too high.All of the proposals need 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to advance. In December, just one Senate Democrat voted against Feinstein’s plan, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. The moderate senator, who is up for reelection in 2018 and has been a source of deep frustration for gun-control advocates, has not signaled she will change her mind.Just one Republican voted with the rest of the Democrats in December: Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who has perhaps the toughest reelection race among incumbent GOP senators this fall. He issued a news release Friday touting himself as a co-author of the Feinstein plan. The NRA is keeping the pressure on Republicans to hold the line. In an interview on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday, the groups vice president and chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, called the Democratic push for new gun restrictions an intentional distraction.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.                 An analysis by Moodys said that under almost any scenario, a Donald Trump presidency would diminish the American economy.  GettyDonald Trump’s presidency would significantly weaken the country, driving the U.S. into a lengthy recession with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody’s Analytics analysis released Monday. The analysis examined the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s economic plans at face value, based on interviews, speeches and his campaign website. The authors of the report, however, warned that quantifying the real estate mogul’s economic polices is complicated by their lack of specificity.Broadly, Mr. Trump’s economic proposals will result in a more isolated U.S. economy. Cross-border trade and immigration will be significantly diminished, and with less trade and immigration, foreign direct investment will also be reduced, Mark Zandi, Chris Lafakis, Dan White and Adam Ozimek wrote in the report. His policies would also diminish the country’s growth prospects, grow federal government deficits, increase the nation’s debt and finance his mix of much lower tax revenues and few cuts in spending with substantially more government borrowing.Driven largely by these factors, the economy will be significantly weaker if Mr. Trump’s economic proposals are adopted. Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office, the authors wrote. By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7%, compared with below 5% today. During Mr. Trump’s presidency, the average American household’s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline.The report also determined that Trump’s plans would hit the middle class the hardest while high-income earners would benefit the most from his tax breaks.Everyone receives a tax cut under his proposals, but the bulk of the cuts would go to those at the very top of the income distribution, and the job losses resulting from his other policies would likely hit lower- and middle-income households the hardest, the report said. The decline in wealth caused by weaker stock prices and housing values would be felt by all households. Even allowing for some variability in the accuracy of the economic modeling and underlying assumptions that drive the analysis, four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached: 1) they will result in a less global U.S. economy; 2) they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; 3) they will largely benefit very high-income households; and 4) they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment, the report stated.Trumps campaign did not respond when asked to comment on the analysis. The analysis acknowledges that presidential candidates often put forth proposals that are as much political statements as firm policy positions, adding that candidates don’t anticipate their proposals to go through the legislative process fully intact and that Trump’s policies should be viewed in that capacity.Nevertheless, what he is asking for is fiscally unsound, the authors concluded. His tax and spending proposals will result in very large deficits and a much higher debt load. A future Congress may be able to rein in this profligacy, but it will not be easy, as there is a gulf between what he says he wants on taxes and spending and what it will take to make the budget arithmetic work, they wrote. He is also very suspicious of globalization. His willingness to threaten higher tariffs on U.S. trading partners and his sharp criticism of major trade deals signal a reversal on the long-running expansion of U.S. trade and foreign investment. Requiring millions of undocumented immigrants to leave the country also signals less openness to the rest of the world.Under almost any scenario, according to the analysis, the result of Trump’s economic policy positions is that the U.S. economy will be more isolated and diminished.Moody’s Analytics will also release an analysis of Hillary Clinton’s proposals. NEW YORK — Big Wall Street donors have a message for Hillary Clinton: Keep Elizabeth Warren off the ticket or risk losing millions of dollars in contributions.In a dozen interviews, major Democratic donors in the financial services industry said they saw little chance that Clinton would pick the liberal firebrand as her vice presidential nominee. These donors despise Warren’s attacks on the financial industry. But they also think her selection would be damaging to the economy. And they warned that if Clinton surprises them and taps Warren, big donations from the industry could vanish.If Clinton picked Warren, her whole base on Wall Street would leave her, said one top Democratic donor who has helped raise millions for Clinton. They would literally just say, ‘We have no qualms with you moving left, we understand all the things you’ve had to do because of Bernie Sanders, but if you are going there with Warren, we just can’t trust you, you’ve killed it.’Most big donors don’t want Warren on the ticket because she is the most accomplished anti-Wall Street populist in the Democratic Party. But many also think her presence would drive a potential Clinton administration too far to the left, poison relations with the private sector from the start and ultimately be damaging to the economy.A constant theme that emerged in the interviews is that executives in the financial industry believe the first 100 days of a Clinton administration could feature potential deal making with Republicans, who are likely to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives.The dream deal for Wall Street would be a combination of targeted infrastructure spending that appeals mostly to Democrats and corporate and international tax reform that could bring Republicans along. The fear is that Warren would make such a deal more difficult.Clinton is going to face a divided government unless there is a total tsunami, said one moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry. What you want in a vice president is someone who can negotiate for you on the Hill, someone like Joe Biden. And that is not a Warren strength.All of the donors and senior Democrats interviewed for this story demanded that their names not be used both because they were not authorized to speak about the Clinton campaign’s internal deliberations and because they feared Warren’s wrath. There is no upside to my talking to you on the record, one big donor said. Either I piss off the Clinton campaign or I piss off Warren, or both.Several donors said they did not really fear Warren going on the ticket because they do not believe Clinton has a strong relationship with the senator and would not trust Warren to be a loyal No. 2, either on the campaign or in the White House.First of all, they don’t particularly like each other, said one prominent hedge fund manager who has raised millions for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton before her. But, the manager added, The absolute predicate for a vice presidential nominee is they have to understand they are No. 2 both during the campaign and once you take office, and I just don’t think Elizabeth Warren is that type of person.The distaste for Warren in the banking industry is not surprising. No American politician in recent history has done more to harness the powerful anti-Wall Street sentiment that continues to rage in the country since the financial crisis of 2008.Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that many bankers dislike, and she continues to push for far stronger regulations including breaking up the nation’s largest financial institutions into smaller, simpler pieces. This is exactly the reason that many on the left, including ardent backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, want to see Warren on the ticket.It’s very clear that Wall Street guys don’t like her because she has been a lot more effective than most in communicating an anti-Wall Street message that has been part of the Democratic Party for 80 years, since the 1930s, said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College. It’s not so much that Wall Street doesn’t like her personally, most of them don’t even know her, but they don’t like anyone that espouses that particular ideology.A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment for this story. A representative of Warren did not respond to requests for comment.Clinton earlier this month said she thinks Warren is qualified to be vice president. I have the highest regard for Sen. Warren, she said in an interview with Politico. I think she is an incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role. I look forward to working with her on behalf of not only the campaign and her very effective critique of [Donald] Trump, but also on the issues that she and I both care about.Warren has maintained the typical stance of potential vice presidents, saying she is perfectly happy in her current job. But she has some powerful backers pushing Clinton to pick her for the vice-presidential slot, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).People close to the Clinton campaign say that while Warren might not wind up as the vice-presidential selection, Wall Street executives are dead wrong to think that it couldn’t happen.They say Warren is very high on the list of possible vice presidential candidates along with Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; and Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, among others. We are not at the point of ruling anyone in or out, a person close to the process said.Picking Warren would be risky for Clinton’s fundraising operation. The presumptive Democratic nominee hopes to raise $1.5 billion for her campaign against Trump, and Wall Street has been a big source of funding for her over the years.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton and outside groups supporting her have raised $289 million so far in the 2016 cycle. The securities and investment industry is easily Clinton’s top source of cash, donating over $28 million so far, according to the CRP.Things are so volatile now with all of the outside groups that all it can take is pissing off one billionaire on Wall Street to make it difficult, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the CRP. And you don’t run national campaigns for as many years as Clinton has without some serious support from Wall Street, they are just too much of a heavy hitter.The progressive case for Warren holds that she would immediately energize the liberal base and bring Sanders voters into the fold. And Warren backers note that the senator has been an early and enthusiastic basher of Trump and shown a knack for getting under the presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s skin.Elizabeth Warren very effectively called out Donald Trump for cheering the Wall Street collapse because it would make him money — and that moment reminded Democrats how powerful Warren’s megaphone can be, said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Whether it’s as vice president or as co-chair of the presidential transition committee, it’s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton not wanting a very large role for Elizabeth Warren at the table.But more moderate Democrats in the financial services industry argue that Sanders voters will come on board anyway and that Clinton does not need to pick Warren to help her win.We are going to win this. Trump shouldn’t be president and he isn’t going to be president, said one senior executive at a Wall Street bank who is close to Clinton. Picking Warren would indicate weakness and panic for no reason and make them look like they are running scared of Trump. There will be plenty of time to galvanize the left and get them to come out. And Warren would be a nightmare to try and manage.Another argument against putting Warren on the ticket is that she can be just as effective a surrogate while maintaining her power base in the Senate.In the current era of presidential politics, social media has allowed more people to assume the role of attack dog that was traditionally left to the vice-presidential nominee, said Jason Rosenstock, an analyst at Thorn Run Partners who covers the financial industry. Warren has shown an excellence in the platform that would allow her to help the campaign incredibly while maintaining her growing position of power in the Senate.On the economic front, some moderate Democrats and financial executives worry that having Warren as vice president would poison relationships between business and the White House from the beginning of a potential Hillary Clinton administration.These people say there is an opportunity for much better relations between business and the White House than during President Barack Obama’s tenure, as well as more effective deal making with Congress to avoid the kind of fiscal crises that damaged the economy the past six years. In addition to cutting deals on taxes and infrastructure, Wall Street worries about the return of the debt ceiling as a potentially big issue in 2016, as well as the return of sequester spending cuts.There is going to be a lot to deal with in the first 100 days, and I’m not sure going left and picking Warren would be particularly helpful, said a top financial services lobbyist in Washington.This Democrat, along with several Wall Street donors mentioned Kaine as the ideal vice-presidential pick. The Virginia Democrat comes from a key swing state, is fluent in Spanish, sits on the Armed Services Committee and is generally palatable to both progressives and more business-friendly Democrats.He checks every box, the moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry said. You could see him step in as president, he is credible with the base of the party, and he’s also comfortable spending time with the rich people you need to raise money from. If Donald Trump’s claims that certain of his commercial ventures benefit charity are untrue, he could be held liable under Section 349 of New York’s General Business Law, which forbids deceptive business acts and practices, as well as under charitable solicitation laws, according to legal experts. In promoting products as varied as Trump University, Trump Vodka, a Trump board game and his latest book, Crippled America, the businessman has declared that the proceeds would go to charity. None of Trump’s proceeds from Trump University have gone to charity, and only a few hundred dollars of charitable giving related to Trump Vodka has been accounted for. News organizations have been unable to verify his other claims, and his representatives have been unwilling to provide more information about them or even to confirm them. While lawyers say Trump could be liable in a number of states for false claims, the official most likely to take up the matter would be Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of New York, where Trump resides and is already the defendant in a consumer fraud case brought by the state over Trump University. Referring to Trump’s claims about his Crippled America book profits, a spokesman for Schneiderman’s office said that the law against deceptive business practices was a more likely avenue of pursuit than the charitable solicitation law. But he added that lawyers at the attorney general’s office had not yet decided whether to look into the matter. In recent weeks, Trump has come under fire for exaggerating the amount of money he raised for veterans at a campaign event in January and for donating much of that money only after reporters began asking questions about it. A state AG investigation of Trump’s other claims of charitable giving would keep the issue alive and burden the presumptive Republican nominee — already embroiled in a number of lawsuits — with another legal headache. At least one congressman from New York says Schneiderman should investigate Trump’s claims about Crippled America. To the extent jurisdiction exists, it seems appropriate that the attorney general should examine whether Trump’s fraudulent schemes extend to his book-promotion activity, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries told POLITICO. Neither Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, nor Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, responded to multiple requests for comment. At an October campaign stop in Iowa, Trump plugged the upcoming release of the book, saying, With everything else I’m writing books. This was the last thing. But it was a lot of money that’s going to go to charity, and frankly, I think the title is amazing. That same day, Trump’s director of social media, Dan Scavino, tweeted, Proceeds of @realDonaldTrumps book, ‘Crippled America’ (coming soon) will be going to charity. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Scavino did not respond to a request for comment.At a press conference tied to the book’s release at Trump Tower in New York last November, Trump said, The profits of my book? I’m giving them away to a lot of different people, including the vets.So far, Trump has made somewhere from $1 million to $5 million in royalties on the book, according to a personal financial disclosure filed last month with the FEC, but Hicks did not respond to repeated questions about whether any of the proceeds went to charity and no donation has been publicized. If Trump fails to follow through on the statements made by him and his employee, he could be running afoul of the law, according to James Fishman, an emeritus professor of law at Pace University with expertise in non-profit organizations. In terms of promising to give money to charities, that can be looked at as fraud if he has gotten people to contribute on that basis, Fishman said.The charity claims made their way into numerous news reports, social media posts and online reader reviews of the book. Thank You For Donating Proceeds To Vet Charities!!! reads the subject line of one review on Amazon. Proceeds to charity GREAT BOOK! proclaims another. A Facebook page set up to promote the book includes a post that reads, ’I just started reading this and it is a great book already and Im glad you are donating the proceeds to charity!’ - Joe (Unsolicited Amazon Testimonial).A Trump fan Facebook group promoted a link for pre-ordering the book this way: Trump has just went live with the ‘pre-orders’ of his brand new book, Crippled America!! Trumps campaign manager also confirmed that the proceeds for the book go directly to CHARITY! Support the cause, get educated, and help us MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Secure your copy by pre-ordering today.In general you can’t promote a book by saying the benefits will go to charity when that’s false, and that’s where general consumer protection laws would come in, said Dan Kurtz, a former assistant attorney general of New York in charge of the state’s Charities Bureau.Kurtz added that Trump might also be subject to New York’s charitable solicitation laws. Those regulations generally apply to instances where a business markets its goods as benefiting a particular charitable organization, but Kurtz said Trump’s vaguer marketing claims arguably also fall under that law as well.Kurtz said that the book’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, might be on the hook as well for claims Trump made. A spokesman for the publisher declined to comment on the record. Crippled America is not the only money-making venture that Trump has publicized as benefiting charity. He has also claimed that proceeds or profits from Trump University, Trump Vodka, The Art of the Deal and a Trump board game would benefit charity. Promoting Trump Vodka in 2006, Trump told Larry King, Im giving the money to charity. But the only apparent donation related to Trump Vodka is a few hundred dollars given to a group supporting Walter Reed Hospital in connection with a specific promotion, as reported by CNN last month.Trump marketed Trump University as a charitable venture and said he would give any money he made off of it to charity, but he has not given money from it to charity, as Time reported in November. Trump’s lawyer told Time that the New York billionaire transferred the $5 million he made from Trump University, which is embroiled in multiple fraud lawsuits, back to the business when it landed in legal trouble. Kurtz said that while older marketing claims of charitable giving, if false, might be too stale to pursue on their own, they would be relevant to more recent cases, like that of Crippled America.If somebody could demonstrate there’s a pattern, even if the claims themselves aren’t actionable, it shows the propensity to do it, he said. It reinforces the case. Bernie Sanders is on a crash course with the Congressional Black Caucus.In a letter sent to both the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, the CBC is expressing its resolute opposition to two key reforms demanded by Sanders in the run-up to the Democratic convention: abolishing the party’s superdelegate system and opening Democratic primaries up to independents and Republicans. The Democratic Members of the Congressional Black Caucus recently voted unanimously to oppose any suggestion or idea to eliminate the category of Unpledged Delegate to the Democratic National Convention (aka Super Delegates) and the creation of uniform open primaries in all states, says the letter, which was obtained by POLITICO. The Democratic Party benefits from the current system of unpledged delegates to the National Convention by virtue of rules that allow members of the House and Senate to be seated as a delegate without the burdensome necessity of competing against constituents for the honor of representing the state during the nominating process.The letter — which was also sent to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz — follows a Wednesday CBC meeting where members discussed for over an hour the impact of eliminating superdelegates on the African-American community, according to CBC Chairman Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.). We passed a resolution in our caucus that we would vehemently oppose any change in the superdelegate system because members of the CBC might want to participate in the Democratic convention as delegates but if we would have to run for the delegate slot at the county level or state level or district level, we would be running against our constituents and were not going to do that, said Butterfield. But we want to participate as delegates and thats why this superdelegates system was created in the beginning, so members would not have to run against their own constituents.The opposition to open primaries is based on the fear that allowing independent or Republican voters to participate in Democratic primaries would dilute minority voting strength in many places.The superdelegate system has been a flashpoint throughout the campaign. Sanders and his supporters have railed against the unelected superdelegates, who have the freedom to back any candidate they choose. This year, the vast majority of them have endorsed Clinton — many of them before the first votes of the primary season were even cast. In states where Sanders has won the popular vote but not the support of the state’s superdelegates, it’s led to deep resentment at the grassroots level and fueled claims that the nominating process was rigged. In Wyoming, for example, despite defeating Clinton in the states April 9 Democratic caucuses by 56 percent to 44 percent, Sanders actually suffered a net delegate loss because the state’s four superdelegates all backed Clinton.According to the Associated Press, Clinton currently has the support of 587 superdelegates to 48 for Sanders.Several state Democratic conventions in recent months considered resolutions abolishing the superdelegate system, or changing it so that superdelegates must align themselves in proportion to the outcome. The pressure to eliminate or modify the superdelegate allocation process has led some senior party leaders to express support for reform. Im very open to a reform that says the superdelegates have to vote with the preferences of their state, said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a former DNC chairman. Thats not a problem —in the same proportion.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the party’s most influential liberals and a Clinton supporter, criticized superdelegates during the Massachusetts Democratic state convention.I’m a superdelegate, and I don’t believe in superdelegates, Warren told reporters at the June 5 convention. Many African-American lawmakers, however, are loathe to give up any influence and hard-won gains in the selection of the Democratic nominee. In a letter accompanying the CBC letter to Democratic colleagues, Rep. James Clyburn — a member of House leadership and co-chairman of a 2009 commission that reviewed the Democratic nominating process — strongly pushed back against criticism of the superdelegate process.Let me be clear, our delegate selection process is not rigged, Clyburn wrote in the separate letter, also obtained by POLITICO. It is transparent to the public and open for participation for all who wish to declare themselves.The Sanders campaign declined to comment on the letters. Retaining some kind of superdelegate system has been a high priority for CBC members, said Democratic strategist Doug Thornell, formerly the group’s communications director. Sanders did a lot of things right in this campaign, he did a lot better than expected. At the same time he seemed to have a lack of understanding or lack of relationships with black leaders that you saw ultimately hurt him in South Carolina and other states with big black electorates, Thornell said. And this is something that the CBC is going to be very passionate and push back against. This is a way that African-American officials can represent their district and have a say in the process. Theyre not going to go along with this at all.Multiple CBC members conceded that the superdelegate system has its flaws, but also argued its not worth scrapping. Ive been listening to both sides, all sides of the debate and I think both sides have made persuasive arguments, said one CBC member, who asked to not be named. The superdelegate system is not perfect but it has worked for us quite well over the years and frankly the superdelegates have never needed to cast any superdelegate votes to alter what the voters did during the primary elections, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Never. Thats not the case this year either. The concern many of us have, of course, is that our numbers would shrink in terms of having influence over and involvement with what happens at the convention.Cleaver added that the CBC would not be swayed on the superdelegate issue. The black caucus is immovable on this subject because our number one concern is going to be an always be the highest level of minority participation as possible at the convention, Cleaver said. Youre going to see the same thing with the Hispanic Congressional Caucus. Mr. Sanders, if he had met with either or whats called the tri-caucus, he would have found out there is no flexibility. Donald Trump sought to clarify his positions on guns on Monday, the morning after the National Rifle Association’s top two officials said his advocacy of Second Amendment rights had gone too far — even for them.At a Friday night rally in Houston, Trump suggested that the terrorist attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub might have been avoided or least made less deadly if more people inside the club had been armed. It would have been a beautiful sight, Trump said to the raucous Texas crowd, to see armed patrons shoot the son of a bitch.But Monday morning, Trump backed away from that comment in a post to Twitter, writing that he was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.The presumptive Republican nominee’s backtracking brings him in line with the NRA after the gun-rights groups top two officials criticized Trump in separate appearances on Sunday-morning political talk shows. NRA Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said on CBS’ Face the Nation that he didn’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, was sharper in his criticism of Trump’s stance. No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms, Cox said on ABC’s This Week. That defies common sense. It also defies the law. Its not what were talking about here.The NRA later tried to clarify LaPierre’s statement on Twitter, writing on his behalf that it’s fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar serving alcohol as long as you do not plan to drink.Its not the first split between Trump and the NRA, which endorsed him in May at its leadership forum in Louisville, Kentucky.Last week, Trump promised to meet with the NRA about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.Our position is no guns for terrorists — period, the association replied. Due process & right to self-defense for law-abiding Americans. Now that Hillary Clinton has dispatched Bernie Sanders, she’s making a big play for one of his core fan bases: young voters.The first high-profile Sanders staffer, specializing in college student outreach, decamped earlier this month from Burlington to Brooklyn, joining other battleground state aides who had worked for the Vermont senator and are now in Clinton’s camp. Advisers to both candidates say more Sanders staffers will be hired soon. Meanwhile, Clinton’s allies in the environmental, labor and women’s health communities are tapping into the same data, digital and other messaging tactics that Sanders used to such great effect in galvanizing millions of millennial supporters. And talks are ongoing between both campaigns about how to deploy Sanders later this summer and fall as a Clinton surrogate. The Clinton camp wants him to make his largest splash with the young cohort captivated by his Brooklyn-tinged talk of revolution.They’re discussing all these things now, and once they figure it out, that’s what he’ll be doing, Sanders’ senior adviser Tad Devine told POLITICO.For Clinton, moving ahead of the Democratic National Convention to start targeting young voters is a vital play to unify a part of the party base that came out in record numbers to propel Barack Obama into the White House in 2008 and then assisted with his reelection four years later.Millennials, roughly defined as someone born between the early 1980s and the closing days of the Bill Clinton presidency in 2000, are now larger in size (75.4 million, according to a Pew Research Center report from April) than the Baby Boomers (74.9 million). But they have an unproven track record when it comes to actually voting. But Clinton won’t be alone in appealing to millennials. They represent a unique pickup opportunity for the biggest wild card of 2016, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump is anything but a traditional candidate, and on issues like gay marriage, student debt and Planned Parenthood he’s said enough to muddy the partisan battle lines and come across as at least a more moderate option than many of his peers in the GOP. Of course, for all of those remarks, Trump’s rants about everyone from Mexicans to Muslims and the disabled also stand out as big turnoffs for millennials. People want candidates who are kind to people of all walks of life. That’s not really what Donald Trump exudes, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a GOP pollster and author who has written about her party’s need to appeal to millennial voters, said last week during an event co-hosted by Ad Age Magazine and Time Inc.Trump’s celebrity status prior to his presidential campaign makes him a unique cultural phenomenon for younger people who have grown up knowing him more as host of his own reality TV show. It’s one of the reasons why a Saturday Night Live parody viral video with Trump dad dancing to a song by the rapper Drake has garnered more than 7 million views on YouTube. Trump’s obsessive social media presence and the sheer size of his follower base means he will be a frequent presence for young voters via their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat apps, even for the people who don’t necessary want to see posts about him. Where he has a distinct advantage, he’ll find untraditional ways to get into their stream of life that could impact and help him at least resonate, Zac Moffatt, who worked in 2012 as digital director for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said in an interview.                            Supporters cheer as Bernie Sanders arrives at a campaign rally at Penn State University, Tuesday, April 19.  AP PhotoTrump has the Clinton campaign and its allies especially nervous because he polls well with younger men and has even come within striking distance among 18-to-29 year olds in some recent polls, including an ABC News/Washington Post survey that showed a 17-point swing toward the Republican between March and May and a Public Policy Polling survey released last week in the battleground of Virginia where Clinton’s lead shrinks to 36 percent to 28 percent when voters have the option of voting for the Libertarian and Green Party candidates. But while those data points are disconcerting for Democrats, they also aren’t seen as insurmountable either. There are other public polls showing Clinton crushing Trump in head-to-head contests, including a Harvard Institute of Politics survey from earlier this spring where she led by 36 points and a Bloomberg Politics national survey out last week where she was ahead 3 to 1 among likely voters between 18- and 29-years old.While Sanders may have netted an estimated 1.2 million more votes than Clinton among 18- to 29-year olds during the 2016 primary and caucus contests, the general election will draw in millions more young people who didn’t bother to participate in their primaries and caucuses, let alone register to vote. That means their choices will essentially boil down to a pick among Clinton, Trump or a third party candidate. Or they could decide not to turn out at all.You’re not going to spend your time on millennials who are not going to come out to vote at least in the ground game going into November in the same way a brand wouldn’t spend all of its time and resources going after someone who is only going to maybe try their product one out of five times, said Beth Lester Sidhu, the chief operating officer at the Stagwell Group, an investment firm founded by former Clinton 2008 campaign chief strategist and pollster Mark Penn.Clinton campaign aides said in interviews that they were well aware of the challenges they face just in getting young people engaged with their campaign. After all, their attempts during the primaries to connect with younger people were frequently met with online mockery, including a request for feedback about student loan debt via emoji and a quick Snapchat video of Clinton rapping next to a river in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that has since gone viral with more than 29 million views. But even as Clinton’s hipness comes under question, her aides say she’ll embrace her age – 68, which is actually two years younger than Trump -- and inner policy wonk. She doesn’t need to be cool. She just needs to be who she is, said Sarah Audelo, the Clinton campaign’s youth vote director. That’s what young people are interested in. Young people want authenticity.The Clinton youth vote gameplan includes targeting different subgroups of the millennial generation on their own turf. High school students who will be 18 by Election Day can expect to get their own special pitch. Different messages will be directed at college students, young professionals just getting started in their careers and older millennials who have started families. Clinton’s youth-vote staffers are planning to take a listening tour of college campuses and other places where millennials work and congregate. In Brooklyn, youth vote outreach is managed by Addisu Demissie, the longtime Democratic campaign consultant now working as Clinton’s national voter outreach and mobilization director. His chief lieutenants are Audelo, a former political director at the nonprofit Rock the Vote; Anne Hubert, a former Viacom senior vice president leading the millennial outreach effort; and Kunoor Ojha, the first major hire from Sanders’ campaign now running the national campus and student organizing program for Clinton in Brooklyn. Other staffers from the Vermont senator’s campaign are likely to be added in the weeks to come.I’m sure there will be more, said Ken Strasma, a longtime Democratic data and micro-targeting expert who worked for Obama in 2008 and has spearheaded the Sanders effort in 2016. Clinton also has air cover targeting the youth vote coming from several super PACs working on her behalf or taking aim at Trump. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer’s well-funded super PAC, NextGen Climate Action, hired a dozen former Sanders staffers to work on a $25 million anti-Trump campaign. The San Francisco-based group is planning voter registration efforts on some 200 college campuses in six presidential battleground states – Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania – as well as in Illinois, where there is a heated Senate race. The group also plans to target older millennials with a digital-first ad blast in several presidential swing states.Strasma’s firm, HaystaqDNA, has been in talks with the For Our Future super PAC, a group also backed by Steyer, and four labor organizations that are focusing on turning out traditional Democratic voters for Clinton in key battleground states. The pro-choice group Emily’s List has a $20 million campaign targeting young women voters involving SS+K, a New York ad firm that did similar work for Obama in 2008 and 2012.In a speech last week, Sanders said he had been surprised during the primaries by the size of his support among young voters, which he noted he won by huge numbers in many states. While still not officially endorsing Clinton or suspending his campaign, he did promise to work with the presumptive nominee to beat Trump in the general election. Several of his advisers have also started to elaborate on that game plan.                             Bernie Sanders supporters cheer as at a campaign rally on Sunday, April 17, 2016, in the Brooklyn borough of New York.  AP PhotoDevine, a longtime Democratic consultant who before working for Sanders had been a top presidential campaign aide to Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, said young people will engage and will turn out in this election particularly if they feel that there is an agenda being presented that will make a real difference in their lives. The data and targeting tools that Sanders used to great effect in the Democratic primaries, Devine added, will also be available to Clinton. We know who they are. We’ve identified them. They’re part of the process, Devine said. And the modern tools of campaigning, once you’ve identified somebody, give you the ability to contact them, to persuade them and to mobilize them like you’ve never seen before.On the stump, Clinton is expected to get a big boost from several high profile celebrities with appeal to millennials, including pop singer Katy Perry and actress Lena Dunham.Obama also is likely to return to many of the college campuses he once packed back in 2008. But it’s Sanders who many of his campaign aides expect will be a main draw.Said Strasma, He’ll be one of the strongest surrogates for Clinton among young people. PHOENIX — Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a Happy Birthday message.Did he get in touch? the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied, no, but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email. A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite I love Sheriff Joe!It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14 — but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens.Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate. They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America’s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny political correctness of minority groups. Arpaio hit on the formula first — adding a Korean War veteran’s fondness for accumulating .50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance — but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick. I don’t like people to say, ‘He’s copying you,’ Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast.As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does — but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence.During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others?Why would I bite the hand that feeds? he said, shaking his head in disapproval.In Arpaio’s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it’s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him. Im controversial, he added with a shrug. You wouldnt be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I dont think.(In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed — he had the medical bills. In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3.75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriffs real estate transactions.)(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York’s tabloids. Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being controversial was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation. Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he’s strictly a self-made madman.He’s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there’s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news. He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he’s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn’t so bad (there wasnt that much crime when the mob — now, Im not saying thats good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too. ... They will never kill a child or a cop, OK?).He knew I was Jewish, so I got this: Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security. I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people. Im not just saying that because youre Jewish.Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point. The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky, he added. I dont know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money. Actually, Im the only one that ever busted that guy. Do you know that? (I did not.)Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus. When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea — thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter — that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy.Whether it’s gays, ISIS — there’s one other [thing} that nobody is talking about. Everybody there happened to be Latino. Why? — because that was a night for Latino and Cuban, he told me. Why didn’t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn’t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn’t like it? Come on. You’re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS. What about Hispanics? Why isn’t anybody — why hasn’t the news media even asked that question?Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded. He was undeterred.It could be because there is talk around the nation — there’s a lot of people that don’t like Hispanics. Is that a secret? he added.In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics.Oh, and he expended millions in county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama’s fake birth certificate (a crusade he insists isn’t over by a long shot). That’s what got him his first give-’em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump. That’s not dead as far as I’m concerned, he told me.But beneath the bombast, there’s a whisper of a showman’s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump. It’s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician’s power is ultimately derived from the news media — and when they turn on you, look out.I’ll tell you, the day I leave, you won’t know how to pronounce my name, he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack. You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there’s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is. That’s the way it is in politics.Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man’s Donald Trump — same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio’s life story he’s the poor (or at last the working-class) man. His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump’s partial snub. On June 14, 1932, Arpaio’s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him. His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store. And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else’s dinner table until his father remarried.Eighty-four times … you have to look back at your life, he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career — the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the Trumpinator at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood. I never had a mother to grow up with, but that’s the way it is. ... It was a little difficult sometimes when you don’t have a mother and youre bounced from one Italian family to another.Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites. Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country — a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself.The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino — a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics. In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a Make Maricopa Great Again campaign. Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer.Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment — and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control — has the same knack. Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him, he told me. Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field. He’s running again this year and blames the Obama administration’s campaign against his policies for the drop. But local analysts noted a telling shift — support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age.Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona’s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he’d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over out of spite. He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration’s racial profiling case — he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.I think its overstated, he said. I think theres a lot of hype. Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say. We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines. So everybody has to be very careful.You dont think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point? I asked.His answer: No. No. No, I really don’t.When I pointed out that many critics had called him a racist, he waved dismissively.When they cant get you for anything else, its a famous word, ‘racist,’ he said. Do you think it bothers me? It doesnt really bother me. I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want. ... [I’m] probably one guy that really doesn’t [discriminate], you know, and I’m not going to say my best friend is black. ... No, no, no. And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican. I got all these family — but I’m not going to say that. I guess you could still have that and say you’re a racist, you know, but no. I know what I am. Come on.He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two (he’s got my underwear) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate’s claim of a silent majority that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters.Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.All these politicians afraid to go near him, he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.I think everybody is looking at their own elections. I hate to say that, Arpaio added. You know it; I know it. You want me to say it, and Im saying it. ... People have to worry about their own future, their own elections. I understand that. But Im not the type of guy that does that. I dont throw people under the bus. I know there’s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote. People are always saying, ‘Oh, you can’t win if you dont have the Hispanic vote.’He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.If theres anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it’s me, with all the heat I’m taking, right? he said. Any smart guy would do that, but I’m not a smart guy, maybe. Donald Trumps vow to resuscitate the Keystone XL oil pipeline in exchange for a share of its profits has a glaring problem: It risks running afoul of laws against government takings of private property. And even supporters of the project warn that it risks hurting relations with Canada, the nations No. 1 oil supplier.The presumptive Republican nominee has repeatedly pledged to revive the Canada-to-Texas pipeline, a long-standing cause for Republicans in Congress, but Trump has brought a twist. He wants U.S. taxpayers to get a slice of the projects revenue.I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits, Trump said May 26 before delivering an energy speech to an oil-industry audience in North Dakota. Thats how were going to make our country rich again.That proposal may mesh with Trump’s famous fondness for the art of the deal, but it’s not what GOP lawmakers called for in their multiple attempts to approve Keystone over President Barack Obamas resistance. They simply wanted to grant developer TransCanada’s permit request, without making any cash grabs, just as regulators routinely do for countless other energy projects.Trump’s plan could run into legal trouble as a taking of oil industry property, and would probably violate World Trade Organization agreements and Congress’ exclusive constitutional authority to make decisions on taxes, experts say. It has also ruffled some feathers north of the border, with Globe and Mail columnist Jeff Jones writing that the likely Republican nominee’s kooky proposal sounds uncomfortably like nationalization. In fact, why stop at oil pipelines? Jones added. Mr. Trump could demand a fatter take from natural gas lines or even restaurants and retail stores.People in the U.S. oil industry are largely shrugging off Trump’s pitch for Keystone profit-sharing, saying his overall pro-drilling agenda is preferable to Hillary Clintons energy platform. But they’re hardly rallying to the proposal.Youre not building a high-rise here and getting shaken down by the local union for a donation to the pension fund — you’re building a major pipeline through the U.S., one oil industry lobbyist said. Something like this is a deterrent on pipeline investment. It’s not taken seriously, because it’s just completely nuts.Obama rejected Keystone last year after a politically charged review that stretched on for more than six years. Trump first slammed Obama for leaning against the project in 2012, long before the president formally declared that the pipelines 700,000-plus barrels per day of new Canadian heavy oil imports would not make a meaningful contribution to our economy.But not until Trump took his presidential bid to New Hampshire did he begin talking about extracting fresh monetary concessions from TransCanada. Trump told primary voters in November that he would want the government to get 25 percent of Keystones profits.Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who has advised Trump on energy policy, defended the candidate by suggesting a scenario where I think hes onto something that could meet his goals without triggering any legal tripwires. The United States could press TransCanada to allow crude oil from North Dakota a greater share of space in the pipeline, Cramer said in an interview, which would amp up the project’s benefits for the U.S. economy. The Canadian government initially suggested that U.S. oil would make up as much as 25 percent of Keystones capacity, but domestic drillers were committed to getting only around 8 percent before Obama killed the project. (One of Trumps newer and more influential oil-industry patrons, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm, played a leading role in winning dedicated U.S. space on the pipeline.)                            Rep. Kevin Cramer says Donald Trump negotiates on simple terms at the biggest advantage to his position.  AP PhotoCramer added that Trump negotiates on simple terms at the biggest advantage to his position. On the other hand, Cramer said, Im not sure how familiar he is with the economic gains that U.S. states already stand to receive from the 1,100-mile pipeline project — benefits that TransCanada says would include tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes and a $3.4 billion infusion into the broader U.S. economy.Vincent DeVito, a partner at Bowditch & Dewey who served as assistant energy secretary under President George W. Bush, said Trumps idea is not half-baked, because negotiations to sweeten the pot, thats very common in the siting industry. But former Assistant Commerce Secretary Alan Dunn said the demand for extra concessions from the Canadian pipeline could violate a crucial principle of WTO pacts that the U.S. is a party to — a national treatment standard that commits governments to applying the same tax systems to foreign imports and domestic goods.There are just not a lot of ways to do that, to justify a differential tax treatment or regulatory treatment, without violating that national treatment obligation, said Dunn, who served as a lead negotiator on the North American Free Trade Agreement after being nominated to the Commerce post by the first Bush administration.Mark Maddox, who served as acting assistant secretary of fossil energy under George W. Bush, agreed that any arrangement adding a premium on oil coming from Canada, that speaks to NAFTA issues, trade issues.Im not certain what the path to implementing his idea is, added Maddox, who now leads the consulting firm Maddox Strategies.Then again, bumping up against trade agreements may not prove much of a deterrent to Trump, who has condemned NAFTA as a total disaster for the United States and has pledged to rip up deals that put Americans at a disadvantage.Meanwhile, TransCanada might be game for any gambit that wins approval for its long-frozen pipeline. The company responded coldly to Trump at first, telling reporters last month that the U.S. should follow a regulatory model that has been in place for decades — namely, granting appropriate permits to projects that qualify for them. But the company was more equivocal when POLITICO asked if it would nix Trumps pitch outright.One thing that we didn’t emphasize strongly enough in an initial response to Trump, TransCanada spokesman Mark Cooper said by email, is our overall encouragement that the door would be open to approval and that the presumptive nominee is encouraging reapplication. As per the details of what a reapplication would look like, we’ll wait and see when that time comes.Brian Ferguson, CEO of the top oil-sands producer Cenovus, told Canadian television network BNN last month that he expects that aides to a President Trump would explain the economic benefit to him of having more Canadian heavy oil available to U.S. refiners.But the Canadian oil and gas industrys leading trade group stayed above the fray. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers spokeswoman Chelsie Klassen referred comment on Trumps idea to TransCanada, given the hypothetical nature of any agreement between the likely presidential nominee and the company.                 I’m not being vetted. I don’t expect to be vetted, Sen. Mark Warner said.  AP PhotoSen. Mark Warner doesnt expect to be vetted as Hillary Clintons running mate — but he did push fellow Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as a potential vice presidential pick.I’m not being vetted. I don’t expect to be vetted, he said in an interview with the Virginian-Pilot. Warner did, however, say of Kaine: There’s nobody with better integrity and trustfulness ... Secretary Clinton and the country would do well by him.Kaine is frequently cited by pundits as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, but in an interview earlier this year, Virginias junior senator said he would be a senator in January, not vice president.I’m going to be sworn in again in the Senate in January … Kaine said in April. Virginia is a key swing state in the 2016 general election.                  Scene outside Philadelphias City Hall as gatherers hold a candle light vigil for those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.   M. Scott MahaskeyThe House on Thursday blocked an amendment that opponents said would have taken away critical intelligence tools just four days after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The 198-222 vote is a blow for privacy advocates who have spent years building support for the amendment, which would have barred the government from forcing companies to weaken their encryption for law enforcement. The provision passed the House twice in 2014 and 2015 by wide margins, before being stripped each time during conferences with the Senate.But Sunday’s deadly assault in Orlando, in which suspected Islamic State supporter Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, caused a drastic erosion in support for the language. Opponents cited the attack as the main reason Congress couldn’t approve the amendment.This amendment prohibits the government from searching data already in its possession collected lawfully … to determine whether Omar Mateen was in contact [with terrorists overseas], said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) during the extended debate over the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations bill.Investigators have said they’re trying to determine whether Mateen communicated with any terrorist groups at home or abroad — a task that would be made more difficult if he used encryption to shield data on his phone or computer.Privacy advocates accused Goodlatte and other detractors of using fear tactics to reduce support for what has been a widely supported House amendment for two years running.It’s unfortunate my colleagues would take advantage of that situation, said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who co-sponsored the amendment with Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). The language does not take any tools away from those that want to investigate what happened in Orlando, Massie insisted.Advocates argue that the provision merely prevents the NSA or the CIA from requiring anyone to alter their products to allow digital snooping. They say this would preserve the encryption that protects the nation’s power grid, air traffic control system and all smartphones.Our government should strengthen the technology, Lofgren said, not take advantage of it.The Massie-Lofgren amendment will make America safer, she added.But national security-focused lawmakers worry that fully encrypted devices, such as the latest iPhones, and a growing array of encrypted apps are preventing authorities from reading digital communications even when they have a lawfully issued warrant. The dispute came to the fore following December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., when the FBI took Apple to court in an attempt to force the tech giant to help the Bureau crack into an iPhone used by shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The Justice Department dropped the San Bernardino case after the FBI said an unidentified third party helped it unlock Farook’s phone, leaving the larger legal question unresolved. The Manhattan district attorney’s office alone has said it has more than 270 iPhones that it’s been unable to crack. Sunday’s deadly attack proves once again that the terror threat has not dissipated, Goodlatte said. Now is not the time to block a critical investigative tool.Thursday’s vote represents a shift in congressional priorities since former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the extent of the government’s clandestine surveillance apparatus.In the wake of those disclosures, liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans came together to press for surveillance reform. Eventually, the bipartisan coalition pushed through the USA Freedom Act, the first major rollback of the NSA’s spying authorities in a generation. The House also got the Massie-Lofgren amendment approved 293-123 in 2014 and 255-174 the next year as part of two annual spending bills.But following major terror attacks both at home — in San Bernardino and Orlando — and abroad — in Paris and Brussels — hawkish lawmakers have moved to retain or expand government surveillance authorities.Numerous hawkish lawmakers have introduced bills to either delay surveillance reforms or strengthen the government’s ability to collect data. A widely supported email privacy bill — which would require law enforcement to seek a warrant before accessing stored email — is even being held up in the Senate over an amendment that would let the FBI use national security letters to obtain email and Internet metadata.                 The U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians.  John Shinkle/POLITICOThe House of Representatives is telling the military to lower the volume. Lawmakers who have been advocating for reducing the size and cost of military bands — now a half-billion-dollar a year enterprise — won a key victory Thursday with passage of a provision that would bar funding for musical units to play at dinners, dances or social events.The provision, the handiwork of Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, would ensure funds are not spent on entertaining generals, dignitaries and elected officials, all the different type of things that have nothing to do with appropriate military ceremonies but reserved for ceremonial tasks such as funerals.Her bipartisan amendment to the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations act was approved by voice vote.From their humble origins in the American Revolution’s fife-and-drum corps, the U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians — with some members outfitted with $11,000 flutes and $12,000 tubas. For every dollar that is spent on our bands ... to entertain at social functions, thats a dollar were not spending on national security and our troops and our families, McSally said.The band budget has drawn criticism from several lawmakers, including House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who said military bands may not be appropriate at every event.The vote marks the first successful attempt to try to scale back the overall budget for military bands. The amendment was cosponsored by New Mexico Republican Steve Pearce and Minnesota Democrat Betty McCollum, who tried herself several years ago to cap the spending on bands.McCollum in 2011 and 2012 proposed a $200 million annual spending limit on military bands, but the effort got heavy pushback inside the ranks and on Capitol Hill, who argued military musicians are a critical link between the men and women in uniform and those they protect. McSally, an Arizona Republican has made it no secret she hopes to curtail use of the musicians for entertainment purposes, and has spoken out often about how such funds could be better spent to directly support ongoing military operations.She told POLITICO that because military bands are funded through operation and maintenance accounts in each service, with this amendment, We wanted to make sure we werent looking like we were wanting to cut funding to the military personnel account.McSallys had sent a letter, urging her colleagues to back the measure, which she said will ensure military bands perform their proper duties and limit their performances to official ceremonies, honoring the fallen, and playing taps.The amendment comes on top of legislation in the Houses version of the defense authorization act passed last month that would require the Pentagon to determine whether it could ease cuts in combat units by reducing the number of musicians.The language requires the Government Accountability Office to review the cost and size of military bands. It also directs Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take an inventory of the bands and study the feasibility of combining some.It remains unclear whether the Houses decision will prevail when a final appropriations bill is hashed out with the Senate. There is likely to be significant pushback.                  The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office. Its difficult to imagine the old John McCain being this reckless with something so serious, said Kirkpatrick, who is running to unseat McCain from the Senate this November. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington. In a private meeting of Democrats on Wednesday, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) begged his colleagues to push a measure that might have actually prevented Sunday morning’s carnage in Orlando: an assault weapons ban.Cicilline was answering the call of President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, to keep weapons of war off the streets. But Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi nixed it. Better, she said, to focus on barring terror suspects from buying guns. That measure’s a no-brainer for Democrats, she reasoned, and easier to explain to the public. It’s not that we’re not strong enough to make the fight. It’s just that we want to win the fight, Pelosi said to her Democratic colleagues, according to sources in the room. What we are trying to do — and forget the politics — what we are trying to do is save lives. What we are trying to do is to say that the Republicans will not even go to this place which overwhelmingly the American people support.The top gun control advocates in the country share Pelosi’s strategy, as do Senate Democrats. They want to emphasize measures that have broad support — like expanding background checks — rather than trying to take America’s most popular rifle and its copy-cat semi-automatics (like the Sig Sauer MCX used in Orlando) off the shelves. Pelosi aides note, however, that she was a supporter of the 1994 assault weapons ban and has repeatedly called for its reinstatement.We work hard to try to stay out of the polarizing divisiveness that comes with this debate, said Mark Barden, who founded Sandy Hook Promise after his 7-year-old son Daniel was killed three years ago by a mentally ill young man with a Bushmaster AR-15. He doesnt believe those types of firearms have any practical application for untrained civilians, Barden said. However, we’ve identified the lack of engagement as really the No. 1 issue that is keeping this movement from moving forward. By steering around that, we feel like we can bring more people and more voices.Barden, reached on Thursday just after returning to Connecticut following a fundraiser in Washington, added, I want to get something done.Banning the AR-15 and other assault weapons just plays into the National Rifle Association’s warnings about the feds coming to take your guns, gun control advocates reason — and besides, most of the gun deaths that have become miserably routine are committed with handguns. The ban isn’t part of the Everytown for Gun Safety’s platform, said spokeswoman Lizzie Ulmer, though the Michael Bloomberg-backed group is sympathetic to the urge to bar weapons that put the mass in mass shootings. Ulmer said that background checks are the key to keeping dangerous people from using guns to hurt themselves and others.When you take a step back and look at preventing gun violence, it’s really about stopping guns from getting into the hands of these people, Ulmer said. That approach is shared by Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, both of whom stress their personal gun ownership and support for Second Amendment rights. There’s already evidence, meanwhile, that the no fly, no buy campaign is driving a wedge between the NRA and Republicans: Donald Trump, despite receiving a relatively early endorsement from the top gun rights group, drew the line with them on Twitter on Wednesday when he declared that he would meet with its leaders about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns. That prompted a rebuke from Heritage Action on Thursday, which viewed Trump as getting on board with Clinton and congressional Democrats.It took nearly 15 hours of filibustering on the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday for Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to win the promise of votes on background check and terror watch list measures — important statement votes that are widely expected to fail.Nonetheless, many Democrats say they should be pushing for more amid unprecedented unity over gun control. Gay rights groups, teachers unions, immigration advocates and even abortion rights groups have signed on to the cause of gun violence prevention after mass shootings at a gay night club’s Latin night in Orlando, a black church in Charleston, an abortion clinic in Colorado Springs and schools around the country.Cicilline is pushing for a discharge petition in the House, which would require every member to go on the record on an assault weapons ban. He’s getting back-up from the progressive movement: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has collected over 26,000 signatures in support of the discharge petition over the last 24 hours. MoveOn.org has collected more than half a million signatures calling for a ban generally.At major national moments, the lowest common denominator solutions aren’t enough, said PCCC’s Sarah Badawi in an interview Thursday.Obama on Thursday found himself once again expressing grief over another mass shooting, and made sure to talk up the dire risk of assault weapons.Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families, Obama said in Orlando after meeting with survivors and victims’ families. The shooter used a Sig Sauer MCX to kill 49 people and injure 53 others — a high-powered gun that would likely be taken off shelves under an assault weapons ban. Clinton, who highlighted guns as a key area where she was to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, has consistently advocated for an assault weapons ban on the trail. Perhaps more remarkable is her husband’s fresh call for tighter security on the AR-15 after Orlando. Its pretty clear that if youre firing … a lot of ammunition in a short amount of time with a weapon thats designed only to kill, more people will die than if youre stuck with a pistol, Bill Clinton said Tuesday. If the guy had just had a pistol in that nightclub, I dont think anybody believes he could possibly have killed 49 people.That’s in contrast to the weeks after Sandy Hook, when he said the 1994 assault weapons ban had devastated Democrats in that year’s midterms and warned his party not to overplay its hand.While Obama has talked about an assault weapons ban multiple times since the Orlando massacre last weekend, he has yet to mount a big political push for it. Polling also makes clear the higher pay-off for less aggressive measures. While support for a ban has spiked in the wake of Orlando (57 percent of respondents in a CBS poll released on Wednesday back a ban, up from 44 percent in December), almost 9-in-10 Americans support universal background checks, according to that poll, including 82 percent of gun owners. Those figures have held relatively steady since Newtown.That overwhelming support for background checks — along with studies on their effectiveness in reducing gun crime — were why researchers at the liberal Center for American Progress deemed that professional gun control advocates’ shift in focus to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns is appropriate in 2014.However, some Democrats point to strategic benefits of having a vote on assault weapons, even if it’s a lost cause — it’s easier to vote for reasonable gun restrictions if you’re drawing a line on the extreme gun grab. Sixteen Democratic senators voted against the assault weapons ban on April 17, 2013, including the current head of their campaign arm, Montana’s Jon Tester. Yet all but four of them voted in favor of proceeding with expanded background check legislation that same day. Sen. Joe Donnelly used the specter of the ban to explain his vote in favor of the background checks. History shows that Congress begins re-examining proposals that would infringe on citizens 2nd Amendment rights, like the assault weapons ban, which I oppose, only when someone who shouldnt have had guns in the first place uses them to commit mass murder, he said at the time.  When Democrats go on offense and shift the conversation about these bigger ideas, that puts more oxygen in the room to have the conversation about these more important elements, PCCC’s Badawi said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for an assault weapons ban who introduced the 2013 version, said she still feels as strongly.In light of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, I believe we have an obligation to revisit this issue, Feinstein said in a statement Tuesday, adding that she was considering re-introducing the bill and conferring with colleagues. A spokeswoman said Thursday that Feinstein had yet to make a decision.                  President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, in honor of people killed in the shooting at a gay nightclub.  GettyPresident Barack Obama on Thursday demanded that lawmakers put politics aside and move forward on the longstanding impasse over gun legislation in the wake of the latest tragedy.  Obama found himself consoling families of the victims of an Orlando, Florida, massacre that Congress had done little to prevent through legislation, even after mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado.  Today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents and they asked why does this keep happening, Obama said Thursday, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden. And they pleaded that we do more to stop the carnage. They don’t care about the politics. Neither do I. Neither does Joe. And neither should any parent out here.The president spoke for nearly 18 minutes, sharing anecdotes he heard from families and thanking first responders, medical personnel and law enforcement for their response efforts. But he also emphasized the reality of what prompted his visit.   Four days ago this community was shaken by an evil and hateful act, he said.  Indeed, Omar Mateen, a New York-born Florida resident who had pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history Sunday when he rampaged through an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others before he was shot dead by police.As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description, Obama said of the families he and Biden met with. Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives.Obama noted that the families impacted by the Orlando massacre could be any American families.In fact, they are our family. They’re part of the American family, he said. Today, the vice president and I told them on behalf of the American people that our hearts are broken, too, and that we stand with you and that we are here for you and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply.The latest terror attack reignited the debate over gun restrictions. Though Mateen had been investigated by the FBI multiple times, he was able to purchase firearms, including the long gun he used to slaughter 49 people and injure dozens more. This debate needs to change. It’s outgrown the old political stalemates, Obama said of the deadlock over guns. The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why this makes sense.While pledging that the U.S. will ultimately destroy the Islamic State and other terrorist networks with its relentlessness — by disrupting their networks, financing, fighters and propaganda — Obama acknowledged that the past two terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were homegrown and that more needs to be done to stop such events from recurring.If you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we’re gonna have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening, he said before pointing specifically to what transpired in Orlando. Now those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead. Another 53 are injured. Some are still fighting for their lives. Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.Senate Democrats launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster Wednesday to force votes on gun control legislation and expect to vote on gun measures Tuesday. But there’s little hope those votes will result in new laws that restrict assault weapons or other, more modest measures. Obama said he was pleased that the Senate would hold votes but challenged them to do the right thing. I truly hope that senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope that senators who voted ‘no’ on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart, and then I hope the House does the right thing and helps end the plague of violence that these weapons of war inflict on so many young lives, he said.He reiterated that the U.S. can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person who wants to harm others but maintained that by taking action on gun restrictions, Congress can limit the damage being done.Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora or Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally, he continued. I’ve said this before: We will not be able to stop every tragedy. We can’t wipe away hatred and evil from every heart in this world. But we can stop some tragedies. We can save some lives. We can reduce the impact of a terrorist attack if we’re smart. And if we don’t act, he warned, we will keep seeing more massacres like this because we’ll be choosing to allow them to happen. We will have said we don’t care enough to do something about it.Obama contended that Sunday’s attack wasn’t a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rather, he said, they were having fun at a place they considered to be a safe haven.Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way imaginable, Obama said. This was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community. Americans were targeted because we’re a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love. Now if we’re honest with ourselves, if in fact we wanna show the best of our humanity, then we’re all gonna have to work together at every level of government across political lines to do more to stop killers who wanna terrorize us, he added. Principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters during a gaggle en route to Orlando that Obama has had to embark on these trips with too much regularity, but emphasized that the president wanted to meet privately with the families of victims, survivors and law enforcement. He wants to make sure that those families who are going through this unimaginable pain know that the president of the United States is there with them, Schultz said. For understandable and obvious reasons, those conversations will not be in front of the cameras. This healing process is not going to happen overnight. Its not going to be a quick one. Thats all the more reason why the president wanted to be there in person. Obama exited Air Force One on Thursday afternoon alongside Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Corrine Brown, all of whom were greeted by Biden, Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Bill Nelson, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs. The White House said Obama and Biden met with law enforcement officials to thank them for their actions in responding to the attack ahead of a separate meeting with families and survivors, which pool reports indicate lasted about two hours. They also met with owners and staff of the nightclub where the carnage occurred. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J. Trump said that, As of December 31, 1993, DJT had a net operating loss (NOL) carry forward of approximately [redacted]. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains. Management has represented that DJT’s NOLs will be more than sufficient to satisfy all anticipated gains.In other words, Trump’s losses were large enough to prevent him from owing taxes.A similar report in 1993 came to the same conclusion about Trump’s tax obligations in 1991. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes. Indeed, Trump has bragged on the trail that he has leveraged business and tax laws to maximize profits for himself over the years. Nor is it a huge surprise that Trump would not owe significant taxes during the economic slowdown of the early 1990s as his companies teetered near bankruptcy.Still, it is notable that a man living on $450,000 per month — Trump also had a massive yacht and aircraft at the time — could avoid paying income taxes.Trump’s finances were leveraged dramatically in the early 1990s, according to the documents. A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns. When the audit ends, I’m going to present them. That should be before the election. I hope it’s before the election, he said last month.Full tax returns would reveal not only how much Trump earns, but what type of deductions he uses to reduce his taxes and how much he gives to charity.Clinton has released more than three decades worth of tax returns, with the eight most recent years posted on her website.The most detailed reports on Trump’s taxes come from a 1981 report from New Jersey’s gambling commission, which detailed Trump’s income and taxes from 1975 to 1979.Trump claimed income of $76,210, $24,594, and $118,530 in 1975-77, and paid federal taxes of $18,714, $10,832, and $42,386 in those years, according to the report. In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns. I don’t think we should have to beg, infer and guess.                 Billionaire Republican megadonor Charles Koch, pictured in 2012, gave $3 million to the Freedom Partners Action Fund.  AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.                  A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday. O’Brien is a late-night comic. He is also an observer of life in these United States. It is sometimes hard to observe that life and still remain a comic, and I admire him for trying.I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think, he said, his voice growing angrier as he spoke. However, I am the father of two, and I like to believe I have a shred of common sense, and I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semi-automatic assault rifle. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life.I do not know what the answer is, but I wanted to take just a moment here tonight to agree with the rapidly growing sentiment in America that it’s time to grow up and figure this out.Time to grow up. A fine idea. And I really wish the sentiment behind it was rapidly growing. Because not everybody in America will get a chance to grow up. Some of those children we send each morning to the safety of their schools will never make it back home alive. (According to the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, Since 2013, there have been at least 188 school shootings in America, an average of nearly one a week.)On Capitol Hill on Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for a ritual moment of silence in the House chamber to commemorate those killed in Orlando.Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes stood up and walked off the floor instead. Previously, he had tweeted:I will not attend one more ‘Moment of Silence’ on the Floor. Our silence does not honor the victims, it mocks them.The Moments of Silence in the House have become an abomination. God will ask you, ‘How did you keep my children safe’? Silence.If God is an angry God, prepare to know a hell well beyond that lived day to day by the families of the butchered. I will not be silent.’And I, for one, hope he keeps talking, tweeting, speaking out and walking out.Roger Simon is POLITICOs chief political columnist.

Email us at nerdcast@politico.com.Podcast produced by Bridget Mulcahy. Math beats mouth.Donald Trump plans to defeat Hillary Clinton through blustery force of will and word — but the architect of Ted Cruz’s efficient, numbers-focused campaign thinks Trump is making a huge mistake by burning the modern electoral playbook. Jeff Roe, a burly and self-deprecating 43-year-old former baseball umpire and onetime howitzer-crew hand, estimates that the presumptive Republican nominee is costing himself from 2.5 to 5.5 percentage points nationally by refusing to invest more time, energy and cash in data, analytics and a first-rate ground operation.By any calculation those are precious points that Trump, who faces an uphill climb against Hillary Clinton on the electoral map — and has trailed the Democratic nominee in most polls — can’t afford to lose. He dumped our ass, right? He won, we lost, so lets keep everything in perspective, Roe told me during a 90-minute interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast that quickly turned into an intense tutorial in Republican campaign strategy and management — and a warning to the man who beat his boss.(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Theres a trove of information thats done in and around politics that Trump needs to tap, said Roe, who credits Cruz’s big win in the Iowa caucuses to the campaign’s identification and targeting of precisely 9,181 voters who were undecided but had Cruz and Trump as their final choices.It’s worth, on its worst day, 2½ points, and in its best day, 5½ points, he added. So let’s just split the difference and say that Clinton’s running a great [operation]. ... He’s not right now, so that would give her ... 3½ points.In May, Trump, who has the smallest and least experienced staff of any recent presidential campaign, told The Associated Press he thought President Barack Obama’s vaunted get-out-the-vote machine was a chimera, and that Obama really won on account of his own personal popularity, Trump-style.I’ve always felt it was overrated, Trump said, using language that conjured up images of green-eyeshade clerks feeding punch cards into 1970s computers. Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.In the absence of his own operation — or even an understanding of how the increasingly sophisticated system of identifying voters through their purchases, political activities and other demographic information works — Trump is relying on the Republican National Committee’s relatively modest voter outreach department.Big, big mistake, Roe told me. I don’t know everything that he has, but I do know a couple of things, he said. It’s going to be very hard for him to just use the RNC. The RNC has got a very candidate-generic model. ... [In Iowa,] we knew voters’ names and what they cared about and how they received their information.Roe is still close to Cruz and says his boss, like Obama, gobbles political intelligence and data like a professional, with insights candidates of previous eras (and Trump is nothing if not stubbornly retro) lacked.Over the next few weeks Cruz’s team, still largely intact, will conduct an autopsy of the campaign from a data and messaging standpoint and dial-test Cruz’s greatest hits and lowest moments with voter focus groups. The goal is to figure out a path forward, which quite possibly involves a second shot at the big prize in 2020, and Roe thinks Trump, win or lose in 2016, won’t be on the ballot four years from now.If Trump wins, I can’t imagine that he’d be in a reelect, right? he asked. He’s already reached the mountain. You don’t climb Kilimanjaro twice if you’re him. Cruz, conspicuously, remains the biggest GOP name not to endorse Trump. The reason, Roe said, is partly Trump’s decision to go very personal on the senator’s family, but also a professional calculation (with overtones of sweet revenge): Despite Trump’s claim that he’ll bring new independents into the process, 2016 promises to be the same-old base election and he’ll need the hard-core conservatives Lyin’ Ted was so good at galvanizing.Is it possible Cruz won’t endorse?Gosh. Yeah. Yeah, for sure, thats possible, said Roe, adding that he’s had only sporadic contact with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, talking or texting a half-dozen times since Cruz suspended his campaign a month back. I mean, if you learn anything from The Art of the Deal, [it] is you have leverage, you have something that somebody wants. Don’t ever act like you want to make a deal until you make a deal, OK? Then he smiled and eased back in his chair. Trump told Ted, ‘I dont need his votes,’ Roe said, with relish. OK? So that’s one way to look at it. If, at some point in the campaign, he believes he needs the votes and he believes that [they’re] key to him winning, then the conservatives will have leverage, and I think thats really damn important leverage. ... [We’ll be] able to hold him accountable.He refused to say whether Trump has asked Cruz to climb on board yet.Roe says Cruz’s surprising success was the candidate’s doing and not that of his 150-person Houston-based staff. But Republicans on opposing campaigns credit Roe’s stewardship, including an intense focus on metrics found more often in Democratic campaigns, for the Texas senator’s tempered triumph. (Jeff’s pretty good. Cruz won what — nine states? — and everybody thinks he’s the Zodiac [killer], said one former opponent, referencing an online joke that dogged Cruz during the campaign.)It’s not surprising that Roe, who shares his boss’s conservative social views as well as his delight in torturing more moderate Hill Republicans, doesn’t think much of Clinton’s policy positions or her personal political skills. But he’s a fan of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 operations and thinks Trump would be wise to notice the plodding but effective ground campaign she waged against Bernie Sanders.From an Xs-and-Os [perspective]… through a nonpartisan lens, they clearly have that part of their game buttoned up, he said of Clinton’s Brooklyn-based operation, overseen by campaign manager Robbie Mook and an analytics and organizing team that includes many former Obama operatives.Theyre not crushing fundraising, but theyre raising good money. Theyre not crushing ground, but theyre doing it really smart and effective. ... [Clinton voters] have little energy, but they’re overperforming their election night numbers routinely. That tells me that they know what they’re doing on the ground.Roe, who came up in the sharp-elbowed world of Missouri politics and has been known for his own stiletto tactics, offered a few lacerating comments about both major party candidates and their stratospheric disapproval ratings. The irony, he said with a chuckle, is that these people found the only person in the other party they could beat.Even though he dismisses the complaint that Cruz, who buddied up to Trump in early debates, waited too long to pounce, he acknowledges that the crowded field denied the Texas senator the chance to go one-on-one with the reality star.And he thinks that’s the key to beating him.Trump won, in part, because the pack was divided and because Cruz failed to move Marco Rubio and John Kasich aside quickly enough. Yeah, we could take him [mano a mano], yeah, no doubt, Roe told me.In a general election, Trump no longer enjoys the safety of the GOP herd. And with Sanders sliding offstage, Clinton has begun focusing her attacks exclusively on the real-estate mogul, something that didn’t happen until relatively late in the Republican primaries. Taking on Trump is smart, Roe said of her decision to hit the GOP nominee before decisively defeating Sanders in California earlier this month. It will be the thing that saves her.When Cruz finally got tough, Trump began dodging debates — and Roe predicted he’ll soon find an excuse to limit his onstage interactions with Clinton despite the widespread view that Trump’s attacks will make Clinton look weak and beatable.I dont know that theyll have one. ... I bet if they do, they only have one, he said of potential debates. Everybody’s going to bake it into the cake that she’s going to win, and he’s going to look like a fool and say the same things over and over. She will have the apparatus to have the time to prepare. Trump’s his own guy. He’ll be tired.I’m sure he’s going to do one, and he’ll call it a draw. He’ll win the Drudge poll afterwards, Roe added.
