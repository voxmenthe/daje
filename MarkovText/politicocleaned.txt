                 We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said in an interview Sunday he hates the concept of profiling, but at the same time is open to increasing profiling of American Muslims.In a discussion that mentioned the surveillance of American mosques and response to recent terrorist attacks, Face the Nation host John Dickerson asked Trump if he was open to having law enforcement officials single out Muslims in America.I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country, Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. Trump said it’s a concept that must be looked at seriously. He mentioned Israel and others as countries that successfully profile.We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, he said. And other countries do it. And it’s not the worst thing to do. I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to use common sense. we’re not using common sense.Dickerson also asked Trump if Muslims should receive extra scrutiny when buying ammunition and weapons.I don’t know about that, Trump said.

I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, Wayne LaPierre said of Donald Trumps suggestion that there couldve been guns at Pulse nightclub to stop the shooter.  GettyEfforts by Democrats to introduce new gun control legislation amount to little more than a smoke screen intended to shift attention away from failed policy to combat terrorism, National Rifle Association Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said Sunday.What happened this past week is the president, the whole gun ban movement said look over here, divert your attention, take your eyes off the problem, LaPierre told John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation.They don’t want to face the embarrassment of their failure in this terrorist area, and they want to cover their butts and not talk about it.LaPierre pointed to a measure introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that would notify law enforcement should a suspected terrorist attempt to buy a weapon as an acceptable compromise, but noted concerns voiced by FBI Director James Comey that stopping a terrorist from purchasing a weapon could actually alert that terrorist that he or she is under investigation. We need to look at all our vulnerabilities and we need to harden, because they’re coming and they’re going to try to kill us and we need to be prepared, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.The NRA CEO said as far as he knew, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in broad agreement with the association’s stance.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said, arguing that terrorists in California and Paris used firearms to kills dozens of people in places with strict gun laws. He called for armed security in vulnerable targets like malls, churches and schools but stopped short of suggesting that people in bars and nightclubs, like the one where 49 people were shot in Orlando, should be carrying guns.I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, he told Dickerson.Later, the NRA attempted to clarify LaPierres remarks in a post to Twitter. Its fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar that serves alcohol, the NRA wrote on LaPierres behalf, but not if you plan to drink.

Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Fareed Zakaria: Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States?  AP PhotoRussian leader Vladimir Putin said he didnt praise presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump quite effusively as has been reported.Speaking to Fareed Zakaria during a panel discussion in St. Petersburg, Putin responded Friday to a question about his praise for Trump by saying: I only said that he was a bright person. Isn’t he bright? He is.Why do you always change the meaning of what I said? Putin asked in response to Zakarias question about Putin calling Trump brilliant.Zakaria acknowledged the word brilliant may have been a matter of imprecise translation. Putin had made the statement in December, drawing praise in return from Trump for his leadership ability.In the latest discussion, which aired Sunday on CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS, Putin did voice his approval of Trumps willingness to restore full-fledged Russian-American relations, but declined to offer additional support for Trump or anything much in the way of opinions about presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.We never interfere into the internal political processes of other countries, Putin said in his typically expressionless manner.The Russian president did take a slap at American self-righteousness toward other countries when it comes to adherence to democratic processes.Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States? Putin asked Zakaria, adding: Twice in American history, a president was elected who did not get the majority of votes.Putin, presumably, was referring to the elections of 1876 (Rutherford Hayes) and 2000 (George W. Bush) when the candidate who received the most votes did not win in the Electoral College.Putin did acknowledge Americas status in the world: The U.S. is a great power. At the moment, it is probably the only superpower and we accept this fact.The Russian leader said he didnt think the world was sliding toward a new Cold War but did take some digs, direct and indirect, at international sanctions and NATO, which he said needed an external enemy to justify its continued existence.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan took part in the panel discussion, which also focused on topics ranging from Ukraine to Russian athletic doping scandals.

Sen. Ron Johnson on the GOP situation: I think things remain reasonably uncertain.  APLocked in a tough fight for reelection this November, Sen. Ron Johnson said Sunday he plans to support Donald Trump for president but didnt formally endorse the presumptive nominee.There’s a big difference between the two, the Wisconsin senator explained on CNN’s State of the Union after saying he intends to support the Republican nominee.Well to me, he told Dana Bash, endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything, Johnson said. Thats not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I’ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. Ill voice it, whether its Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else.Trump’s controversial candidacy could spell trouble for Johnson this fall, who faces a stiff challenge from former Sen. Russ Feingold, whom Johnson ousted in 2010. A recent Marquette University Law School poll shows Johnson trailing Feingold, 51 percent to 42 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters.Johnson was not willing to dismiss the notion that Trump’s nomination might come undone at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland even though Trump would seem to have more than enough delegates. He said that while he’s not a part of any movement to deny Trump the GOP nomination, nobody can really predict whats going to be the outcome of our nomination process.He also made that point about unpredictability in discussing his support for Trump: It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee.

Some, including Mitt Romney and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have been loudly critical of their party’s nominee.But Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press that he can win in November, with or without their support.Were going to have a great convention and I think were going to go on to a great victory.

Characterizing it as a creation of the media, Trump scoffed at the notion that his pile of delegates could be snatched out from underneath him on the convention floor by a candidate who would like to come in through the back door.So I win 38 states and somebody else won none and they’re going to be the nominee?

I don’t even want that kind of money, Trump said, borrowing a line of attack that Sen. Bernie Sanders used regularly against Clinton during the Democratic primary.

He was a bad dude. I mean, look, will somebody slip through? I guess, Trump told ABC’s This Week in an interview with Jonathan Karl. I guess the gun store owner reported him and the authorities didn’t act on it. What a shame.What does that say to you? Karl followed up.To me, it says very sad. They reported him and the authorities didn’t act, Trump replied. I think it’s very unusual. I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Florida, said Thursday that an unidentified person had come to his store several weeks back and tried to buy body armor, which Abells employees said they did not have. The would-be buyer left the store, and Abell said he reported the individual to the FBI as suspicious. The person, Abell realized after the shooting, was Mateen.In his interview with Karl, taped backstage at one of Trump’s rallies this weekend in Texas, the Republican candidate renewed his promise to talk to the National Rifle Association about banning suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. The presumptive nominee wouldn’t say whether he could budge the NRA on the issue, only that he wanted to find out their thinking.What I want, and I know what they want, they want it as much as anybody in the world, they want to make sure that terrorists don’t get guns, Trump said.

Jeff Sessions said Sunday that somehow, some way, we should be able to make this work.Like many other Republicans, Sessions (R-Ala.) expressed concern that legislation banning suspected terrorists from purchasing guns might infringe on the constitutional rights of those wrongly entered onto terrorism watch lists.He told CNN’s State of the Union that he would be willing to listen to a compromise proposal being crafted by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), praising her diligence and expertise on the various terrorism watch lists and the respective thresholds for inclusion on each one.But a lot of people may be wrongly on the list. In fact, I’m sure there are a lot of people on that list that shouldn’t be on it, Sessions said, without specifying which of the various terrorism watch lists he was speaking of. So if youre going to deny a person a Constitutional right like free speech or the right to have a firearm, then that person has to have an opportunity to explain that they shouldnt be on the list. … Thats what the difference is. Republicans have voted consistently to ban people on that list from having a gun, but to give them an opportunity to prove they shouldnt be on the list. Sessions, one of the most prominent supporters of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, defended the presumptive Republican nominee’s renewed call to temporarily ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Sessions explained that his understanding of Trump’s proposal is that the ban would target nations with a history of terrorist activity and would not prohibit diplomats and business travelers from moving between those nations and the U.S. The senator referred to the proposal as a tightening of immigration policy and named Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as countries that might fall under Trump’s proposal.Sessions also attacked what he called the talking heads in the Republican Party who have steadfastly refused to fall in line behind Trump as the party’s nominee, encouraging them to read Trump’s great speech on immigration and foreign policy last week. He contrasted Trump’s remarks with those of President Barack Obama, whose response has been unbelievably weak.Finally, Sessions said he was not in discussions with the Trump campaign about the possibility of becoming the candidate’s running mate but did reiterate that he’d consider joining the ticket if asked.I only said if I were asked I would consider it. I dont expect that to happen, Sessions said. I have no idea what theyre doing. I suspect people are thinking about it, but it will be an important decision. He needs somebody who can be a great president if something happens to him, somebody who can help him advance an agenda that I think is the American peoples agenda.

I think what’s important is to continue to keep our focus on the victims of this tragic crime as well, Lynch said Sunday on ABCs This Week. One of the things Ill do in Orlando on Tuesday is meeting with victims, talking about the support well be providing them as well.

Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win. Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.

Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge. Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued.

On this day in 1856, the first national convention of the Republican Party ended in Philadelphia’s Music Fund Hall. The delegates nominated as their presidential candidate John Frémont of California, who had gained widespread fame as a Western explorer, with William Dayton of New Jersey as his running mate.Frémont ran on the slogan Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Frémont and Victory! In an election in which nearly 80 percent of eligible U.S. voters cast their ballots, Frémont carried all of New England, plus New York, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin, amassing 114 electoral votes.But he was unable to carry California, which he had briefly represented as a senator after it became a state in 1850.In its platform, the party, founded only two years earlier, called on Congress to bar slavery and bigamy. Not surprisingly, the Georgia-born Frémont fared poorly in the South. Ignoring the slavery issue, the American Party, or Know-Nothings, captured nearly a quarter of the popular vote by running former President Millard Fillmore on an anti-immigration, anti-Catholic platform. James Buchanan, the Democratic nominee, won with 174 electoral votes. A shift of only a small number of votes in several states would have tipped the electoral tally to the Republicans. During the campaign, Frémont decried the expansion of slavery while Buchanan warned that the Republicans were extremists whose victory would lead to civil war. The Democrats endorsed popular sovereignty as the best method to determine slavery’s legality for newly admitted states.Four years later, most Southern states threatened to leave the Union in the event of a Republican victory. On Nov. 6, 1860, Republican Abraham Lincoln defeated the divided Democrats. Six weeks later, South Carolina seceded, with five more Southern states soon following in its wake.On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began when Confederate shore batteries under Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter in South Carolina’s Charleston Bay. The ensuing Confederate defeat entrenched the Republicans as the nation’s prevailing party. Although by 1876 the GOP had lost control of the re-segregated South, the party continued to dominate the presidency, with a few interruptions, until Franklin D. Roosevelt’s victory in 1932.SOURCE: THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, 1854-1966, BY GEORGE MAYER (1967) On this day in 1856, the first national convention of the Republican Party ended in Philadelphia’s Music Fund Hall.

Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together. Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team. But it took a perfect storm for Edwards to triumph in 2015, and there doesn’t appear to be a GOP candidate in the race with Vitter’s personal, party label-defying vulnerabilities.Visit the Campaign Pro Race Dashboard to track the candidates and consulting firms engaged in the top House, Senate, and gubernatorial races of 2016.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney. Woodbury, who has been a delegate to the last six national conventions, won’t be a delegate in Cleveland.Trump’s fraught relationship with the LDS community starts at the top: Romney has been one of the GOP’s most persistent and vocal critics of the nominee. During the GOP primary, Trump questioned the sincerity of Romney’s faith and consistently lost parts of the country with heavy Mormon populations — like eastern Idaho and Utah.Recent general election polls out of heavily Mormon, deep-red Utah have newly underscored Trump’s broader challenge with the community—a community that is troubled by, among other things, his hostile language toward Hispanic immigrants (many Mormons do missions to South America) and his waffling on social issues. The LDS church, which itself suffered much discrimination in the past, released a statement in December saying, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns. However, it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom. The statement came as Trump pushed a proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration. According to the recent most recent Utah poll, Trump is deadlocked with Hillary Clinton in Utah — in a state that hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1964.I cannot go there, said Heidi Wixom, a Nevada Mormon and GOP activist well-respected in the community, of voting for Trump. Pointing to the list of incendiary comments he has made about other minority groups, she continued, Belonging to a church that has felt persecution, you wonder, will his rhetoric continue on? What happens to a group of people he sees aren’t supportive of him? What would he do to them?Trump’s Mormon issue may be felt acutely in a swing state like Nevada. Despite twice voting for Barack Obama, it’s still considered a November battleground. Trump ran well there in the Nevada caucuses but he’ll need an energized base to push him over the finish line. Enthusiastic LDS backing alone won’t be enough to win the state—as Romney demonstrated—but the chilly reception Trump is receiving from top community leaders could help ensure that Nevada stays blue.Wixom said that she spoke with around 40 fellow LDS Republicans in Nevada on Thursday. Five were enthusiastic Trump supporters, seven said they could never back him, and the rest, she said, were holding their noses and preparing to vote for him—but won’t do any organizing for him.Nevada LDS people are not going to say ‘support,’ they’re going to say ‘vote,’ she said. They’re not supporting at large. They’re tolerating and voting. They’re not going to be putting Trump signs in the yards, they’re not going to be rallying around phone calls, they’re not going to help with grassroots efforts.But it’s still early, stressed Ira Hansen, a Mormon Republican assemblyman and the assistant majority floor leader, adding that he expects the community to eventually embrace Trump—at least enough to help him over the finish line. That’s what Hansen did after his favored candidate, Ted Cruz, dropped out.I think we’ll find, when push comes to shove, his platform comes out, a lot of people will rally around, in the LDS community and elsewhere, Hansen said, noting that a solid vice presidential pick and more details on Supreme Court choices could further smooth that path.He went on to add, It’s way premature to start determining what people are going to start doing in August, September, October. The reality is, we haven’t had a convention, we don’t know who the picks are going to be as far as vice president, the Supreme Court, a lot of things that could make a dramatic turnaround.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment and questions about Trump’s Mormon outreach efforts.Plenty of Mormon leaders are adamant that even if Trump eventually gets their votes, he won’t get much of their time.I’m most likely to vote Trump, Christensen said. But I won’t be putting in the blood, sweat and tears like I have with Romney the last several cycles, with McCain. I don’t see a scenario where I do anything but vote for him. Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney.

On this day in 1957, the House, by a vote of 286-126, approved what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The legislative effort held the support of President Dwight Eisenhower as well as most congressional Republicans. Eisenhower signed the final draft into law on Sept. 9, 1957.The law marked the first significant measure to address civil rights since 1875. It established the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for two years, created a civil rights division in the U.S. Justice Department, and authorized the U.S. attorney general to seek federal court injunctions to protect the voting rights of all Americans..This is an hour for great moral stamina, Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., (D-N.Y.) one of three black members then serving in Congress, said on the House floor. America stands on trial today before the world and communism must succeed if democracy fails, he added.Sen. Lyndon Johnson (D-Texas), the majority leader, steered the bill through the Senate. Sen. Richard Russell (D-Ga.) claimed the bill sought to impose the will of the federal government on the states, disregarding the Constitution. The Senate voted to approve the bill after overcoming a filibuster by Sen. Strom Thurmond (D-S.C.), who set a Senate record for speaking 24 hours and 18 minutes. (Thurmond became a Republican in 1964.)The House approved the watered-down compromise measure on Aug. 27 by a vote of 279-97 and sent it to the White House.While the bill alienated Southern Democrats, they lifted their blockade after it became apparent that the measure would do little, if anything, to topple Jim Crow practices in the South. Thus, any person found guilty of obstructing someone’s right to register faced the prospect of a jury trial. In practical terms, that meant a guaranteed trial by an all-white jury — one unlikely to lead to a conviction.Black leaders were divided over the legislation. Ralph Bunche, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a future top U.N. diplomat, viewed the bill as a sham and said he would have preferred no act at all. However, Bayard Rustin of the Congress of Racial Equality said the act was important because of its symbolism: Heretofore, lawmakers had been unable to advance the cause of African-Americans for 82 years. Rustin, who went on to organize the biracial 1963 March on Washington, predicted that it would serve as a base for further action — as, indeed, it did with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.SOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HISTORIAN: HISTORY@MAIL.HOUSE.GOV;  On this day in 1957, the House, by a vote of 286-126, approved what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office.

AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.

The 2012 Republican National Convention is pictured.  GettyRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has selected a veteran Utah Republican leader to chair the rules committee at next month’s national convention — a crucial position that will oversee expected battles on whether delegates can be unbound to reject Donald Trump.In her first phone interview on the appointment, Enid Mickelsen, Utah’s Republican committeewoman, pledged to be fair to all members of the committee.My mindset is that we’re going to be fair, that people are going to be able to have an opportunity to make their proposals, debate their proposals or suggestions, she said. We are going to make this a fair and deliberative process. Nothing’s going to come out of this that’s been done by parliamentary trickery.The convention rules committee, a 112-member panel that consists of two delegates from every state and territory, is empowered to write the rules of the upcoming convention as well as set the framework of the GOP presidential nominating process that will take place in 2020.Mickelsen herself has proposed dramatically altering the calendar of GOP primaries to include a new batch of early states, though she told POLITICO she won’t introduce that proposal as chair, leaving it to others instead.The rules committee is likely to be the beginning of an effort by delegates opposed to Trump’s nomination to alter rules that would free delegates to choose someone else. Mickelsen said she was expecting spirited debate on those matters.There’s been a lot of speculation, there’s been a lot of discussion, but I’m confident in the end we’re going to make this a fair process, she said. Will it be lively? It probably will be at times.Mickelsen said she told Priebus months ago that she was open to chairing the rules committee if he wanted. She’s already the vice chair of the committee organizing the convention and as a result has been neutral in the presidential race so far — which she noted made her a good candidate for the rules post.She said she heard from Priebus with the official offer last night as she was walking into Game 6 of the NBA finals in Cleveland, the site of the convention.I was just walking into Game 6 when he called, he said.She noted that as of Friday morning, a crew was already working to set up the arena for the convention, which begins on July 18.At 8 a.m. this morning, they started unbolting chairs and moving equipment in, she said.

TWITTER SCREENGRABDonald Trump has spent the week stating his support for the LGBT community in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, remarking that he is a better ally than Hillary Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked for accepting donations from governments hostile to LGBT rights on behalf of the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists into our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone else who doesnt share their views or values, Trump said during a speech Monday, a day after 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub in Orlando.But a photo posted to Twitter on Thursday night showed the presumptive Republican nominee with someone decidedly opposed to LGBT rights.Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment, shared a photo in which he posed with Trump at the candidate’s rally at Gilleys, the citys famous honky-tonk.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonight’s Dallas rally, Jeffress tweeted, along with a photo in which they both held their thumbs up. Trump retweeted the image on Friday.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonights Dallas rally. #TrumpDallas c: @DanScavino pic.twitter.com/BcgWuszPnu— Dr. Robert Jeffress (@robertjeffress) June 17, 2016The First Baptist Church pastor in February 2015 was quoted as saying the gay rights movement will pave the way for that future world dictator, the Antichrist, to persecute and martyr Christians without any repercussions whatsoever.Jeffress last month celebrated his states leaders decision to refuse to comply with President Barack Obamas directive to create more accessibility for transgender students in public schools, saying it’s time for an all-out rebellion against this absolute tyranny of the Obama administration.It comes down to money, Todd, that’s what it’s about, Jeffress told Todd Starnes on Fox News Radio. And when states are being faced with the loss of business, they tend to fold real quickly. And I’ve said often that the greatest threat to freedom of religion in America is not ISIS, it’s the Chamber of Commerce. I mean, it’s the businesses that say to our representatives, ‘Oh, don’t pass laws like that, don’t pass these religious freedom laws because people will interpret that as anti-gay and we’ll lose business.’After the Supreme Court last summer ruled same-sex marriage legal, Jeffress said he believed our culture will get increasingly darker, adding that the decision was ultimately irrelevant.The Judge of all of the universe has already issued His decision: marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. And there is no appealing that verdict, he responded.                 Donald Trump poses with Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment.  TWITTER SCREENGRABDonald Trump has spent the week stating his support for the LGBT community in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, remarking that he is a better ally than Hillary Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked for accepting donations from governments hostile to LGBT rights on behalf of the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists into our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone else who doesnt share their views or values, Trump said during a speech Monday, a day after 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub in Orlando.But a photo posted to Twitter on Thursday night showed the presumptive Republican nominee with someone decidedly opposed to LGBT rights.Robert Jeffress, a pastor from Dallas known for his anti-LGBT sentiment, shared a photo in which he posed with Trump at the candidate’s rally at Gilleys, the citys famous honky-tonk.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonight’s Dallas rally, Jeffress tweeted, along with a photo in which they both held their thumbs up. Trump retweeted the image on Friday.Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonights Dallas rally. #TrumpDallas c: @DanScavino pic.twitter.com/BcgWuszPnu— Dr. Robert Jeffress (@robertjeffress) June 17, 2016The First Baptist Church pastor in February 2015 was quoted as saying the gay rights movement will pave the way for that future world dictator, the Antichrist, to persecute and martyr Christians without any repercussions whatsoever.Jeffress last month celebrated his states leaders decision to refuse to comply with President Barack Obamas directive to create more accessibility for transgender students in public schools, saying it’s time for an all-out rebellion against this absolute tyranny of the Obama administration.It comes down to money, Todd, that’s what it’s about, Jeffress told Todd Starnes on Fox News Radio. And when states are being faced with the loss of business, they tend to fold real quickly. And I’ve said often that the greatest threat to freedom of religion in America is not ISIS, it’s the Chamber of Commerce. I mean, it’s the businesses that say to our representatives, ‘Oh, don’t pass laws like that, don’t pass these religious freedom laws because people will interpret that as anti-gay and we’ll lose business.’After the Supreme Court last summer ruled same-sex marriage legal, Jeffress said he believed our culture will get increasingly darker, adding that the decision was ultimately irrelevant.The Judge of all of the universe has already issued His decision: marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. And there is no appealing that verdict, he responded. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way.

Elizabeth Warren visited Hillary Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn and spoke to staffers.  GettyMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a message for Hillary Clinton’s Brooklyn-based staff: Don’t screw this up.Less than a week after endorsing Clinton, Warren on Friday made a pit stop at Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters to rally the troops with an enthusiastic speech to staffers, including the succinct warning that they cant risk losing the election to Donald Trump.Warren spoke to Clinton staffers for about 15 minutes and then lingered to take selfies with the campaign operatives for about 20 minutes longer. One Clinton staffer noted that Warren attracted a crowd bigger than Jon Bon Jovi did when he recently stopped by the headquarters.The progressive standard bearer’s new involvement as a campaign surrogate comes after a meeting last week with Clinton at her Washington, D.C., home and amid growing speculation of whether she will be selected as Clinton’s pick for vice president.Warren is currently the most discussed potential vice presidential pick for Clinton. But sources close to both Warren and Clinton said there remains some ambivalence on both sides: Warren, one source said, would love the platform but remains hesitant to give up the independence that comes from her Senate seat. She respects Hillary enough to know that’s not how it would be, the source said. Clinton, meanwhile, is said to be in the process of vetting Warren, along with a long list of other potential picks, but does not have a historically warm relationship with the populist senator.Despite the intense scrutiny of the relationship between the two women, Warren traveled to New York for the meeting with no entourage or aides.She sat alone on the Acela from Washington, D.C., to New York, reading quietly and was seen chatting with Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, a longtime Clinton ally. Fellow train passengers stopped by to tell her, Atta girl, keep giving it to Trump!For now, both sides appear eager to keep the door and the speculation open for the joint ticket. In an interview with POLITICO last week, Clinton said Warren would be qualified for the No. 2 slot.I have the highest regard for Sen. Warren, she said. I think she is an incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role.                 Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited Hillary Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn and spoke to staffers.

Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J. Trump said that, As of December 31, 1993, DJT had a net operating loss (NOL) carry forward of approximately [redacted]. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains. Management has represented that DJT’s NOLs will be more than sufficient to satisfy all anticipated gains.In other words, Trump’s losses were large enough to prevent him from owing taxes.A similar report in 1993 came to the same conclusion about Trump’s tax obligations in 1991. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes. Indeed, Trump has bragged on the trail that he has leveraged business and tax laws to maximize profits for himself over the years. Nor is it a huge surprise that Trump would not owe significant taxes during the economic slowdown of the early 1990s as his companies teetered near bankruptcy.Still, it is notable that a man living on $450,000 per month — Trump also had a massive yacht and aircraft at the time — could avoid paying income taxes.Trump’s finances were leveraged dramatically in the early 1990s, according to the documents. A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns. When the audit ends, I’m going to present them. That should be before the election. I hope it’s before the election, he said last month.Full tax returns would reveal not only how much Trump earns, but what type of deductions he uses to reduce his taxes and how much he gives to charity.Clinton has released more than three decades worth of tax returns, with the eight most recent years posted on her website.The most detailed reports on Trump’s taxes come from a 1981 report from New Jersey’s gambling commission, which detailed Trump’s income and taxes from 1975 to 1979.Trump claimed income of $76,210, $24,594, and $118,530 in 1975-77, and paid federal taxes of $18,714, $10,832, and $42,386 in those years, according to the report. In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns.

President Barack Obama has long supported the ban of assault weapons, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days.  AP PhotoThe White House is stepping up its efforts to renew the assault weapons ban, while trying to boost separate gun control measures that the Senate plans to vote on next week.On Monday, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett will host a mass conference call for the general public about the need to renew the assault weapons ban and the different gun safety measures the Senate is set to vote on in the coming week.Vice President Joe Biden announced the call in a response to a petition on the White House’s We the People platform on Friday. The request for a ban on the AR-15 assault-style rifle was posted on Sunday, in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting in which were 49 people were killed, and already had nearly 200,000 signatures by Friday. The president and I agree with you, Biden wrote. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership.The Obama administration has pledged to respond to any petition that accumulates 100,000 signatures in a month. This was one of fastest we’ve ever had to cross the threshold, said a White House official.Obama has long supported the ban, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days, condemning the easy access to weapons of war like the Sig Sauer MCX that Omar Mateen used to kill many people at close range. But until Friday’s announcement, it was unclear whether his administration would do anything more substantial to mobilize for a ban.Hillary Clinton has also stepped up her calls for an assault weapons ban on the trail. However, on the Hill, Democrats have focused on getting votes for measures with broader support, including barring people on terror watch lists from buying guns and expanding background checks. The Senate is set to vote on variations of those measures on Monday — though barring major changes, none appear likely to pass.The AR-15 has become the most popular rifle in the country since the original assault weapons ban expired in 2004. In the wake of the Newtown shooting, as gun control groups have become more politically sophisticated, they’ve increasingly focused on measures like background checks to stress that their goal is to take guns out of the hands of dangerous people, not law-abiding Americans. They also not that must gun violence is committed with handguns.But the role of assault weapons in high-profile mass shootings gives the issue emotional weight. In his response, Biden noted that they were used in in Aurora, Colorado, to kill 12 people; in Roseburg, Oregon, to kill 10 and in Newtown, Connecticut, to kill 26.A single person killed that many people in just a few minutes. Not in a war zone. Here in America — in a classroom, Biden wrote.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Biden will be on a call about the assault weapons ban on Monday.

Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership.The Obama administration has pledged to respond to any petition that accumulates 100,000 signatures in a month. This was one of fastest we’ve ever had to cross the threshold, said a White House official.Obama has long supported the ban, but he has been increasingly vocal about it in recent days, condemning the easy access to weapons of war like the Sig Sauer MCX that Omar Mateen used to kill many people at close range. But until Friday’s announcement, it was unclear whether his administration would do anything more substantial to mobilize for a ban.Hillary Clinton has also stepped up her calls for an assault weapons ban on the trail. However, on the Hill, Democrats have focused on getting votes for measures with broader support, including barring people on terror watch lists from buying guns and expanding background checks. The Senate is set to vote on variations of those measures on Monday — though barring major changes, none appear likely to pass.The AR-15 has become the most popular rifle in the country since the original assault weapons ban expired in 2004. In the wake of the Newtown shooting, as gun control groups have become more politically sophisticated, they’ve increasingly focused on measures like background checks to stress that their goal is to take guns out of the hands of dangerous people, not law-abiding Americans. They also not that must gun violence is committed with handguns.But the role of assault weapons in high-profile mass shootings gives the issue emotional weight. In his response, Biden noted that they were used in in Aurora, Colorado, to kill 12 people; in Roseburg, Oregon, to kill 10 and in Newtown, Connecticut, to kill 26.A single person killed that many people in just a few minutes. Not in a war zone. Here in America — in a classroom, Biden wrote.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Biden will be on a call about the assault weapons ban on Monday.                  Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to formally end his campaign for president.  AP PhotoHillary Clinton allies are beginning to put public pressure on Bernie Sanders to end his bid before the convention, suggesting the prospect of a prime time convention speech as an incentive.If I were advising Sen. Sanders, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a longtime Clinton ally, said in an interview, I would say, you’ve done so fabulously, but there’s one thing left you need to do and that’s make a speech in prime time at the convention. You only do that if you’re not contesting the nomination.If Sanders waits to hold a roll call in Philadelphia on the Wednesday of the convention, the only speaking slots left would likely go to President Obama and the party’s nominee. But if he conceded beforehand, Rendell said, Sanders would be in a position to demand a prime time slot on the stage at the Wells Fargo Center. A Clinton campaign spokesman would not discuss the internal convention negotiations underway with the Sanders campaign.But the public push from Clinton allies for Sanders to wrap up his campaign came after the Vermont Senator on Thursday night dodged an opportunity to concede to Clinton. During a 23-minute livestreamed address, Sanders, speaking to supporters from Burlington, said that defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. Network television stations cut away from Sanders as it became clear no concession was planned. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become, he said. And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia.When it came to Clinton, whom Sanders met with Tuesday night in Washington, D.C., he told some 200,000 supporters tuning in via livestream: It is no secret that Secretary Clinton and I have strong disagreements on some very important issues. It is also true that our views are quite close on others.Clinton officials and surrogates have come to expect nothing short of a stubborn and persistent challenge from Sanders over the course of a contentious campaign. But patience is wearing thin among Clinton allies for a vanquished rival who seems to be coming around to his party’s nominee at the speed of a tanker changing course, in an election when time is a scarce resource.The lack of processing, publicly, the fact that he has actually not won, is frustrating, said one Clinton surrogate with close ties to the campaign. Framing his desires as a list of demands when his margin of loss was actually significantly larger than he’s acting, is frustrating.Other Clinton allies described Sanders’ much-hyped speech as unsurprising, but lame nonetheless.  Bernie talks the language of collective action — but only if he is the center of that action, said the political director of a major labor union that endorsed Clinton. He doesnt understand the role of a party, and uniting behind a partys nominee. The address was viewed as an opportunity for Sanders to assure his supporters that he’s still fighting for the principles that energized his supporters, even as he winds down from actively campaigning. But some Clinton loyalists told POLITICO they resented his address because they believe the only reason for Sanders to carry on at this point is his unspoken hope that Clinton is somehow disqualified between now and the July 25 convention.Democratic strategist and former Obama aide Ben LaBolt noted, the clock is ticking for him to not only tell his supporters to defeat Donald Trump, but to get them excited about the ticket. He said he was a Democrat this cycle, that would imply that he would enthusiastically support the ticket.Rendell, however, said he’s willing to cut Sanders just a little more slack -- a mindset shared by campaign officials. I know a lot of Hillary supporters are piqued he didn’t concede, he said. Its Bernie being Bernie. Theres nothing to be upset about. He marches to a different drum.If he takes a week or two, it’s not important, Rendell added. What’s important is he gets the message out that he’s for Hillary before the convention. All the ship has to do is make land by July 25. Campaign officials also remained confident that after the Tuesday night meeting, the two candidates are on a slow path to party unification.Meanwhile, the process of unification is underway without Sanders on board. On Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another progressive standard bearer, rallied the troops at Clinton’s campaign headquarters with a rah rah speech to staffers. But from the outside, there is less certainty of what Sanders endgame strategy looks like.It’s hard to read, said Democratic strategist David Axelrod, also a former top adviser to President Obama, of his reaction to Sanders’ speech Thursday night. You don’t just charge forward at 100 miles an hour and come to a screeching halt, extend your hand and say, ‘Great game.’Sander is right to continue to promote the ideals that animated his race, Axelrod said. But if, as he says, his goal is to defeat Trump, persistent, if implied, lamentations about the shortcomings of the only person now in a position to achieve that goal are not helpful.At some point -- maybe in Philly, maybe before -- he has to land this plane, Axelrod said. And he needs to make the descent more gentle to avoid a crash landing.                 Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to formally end his campaign for president.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California on June 2.  GettyDonald Trump has made it a habit to mention and tweet out favorable poll numbers throughout the course of his campaign. But on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee thanked his millions of followers for the results of a national survey that showed him losing to Hillary Clinton.THANK YOU! #AmericaFirst, Trump tweeted, in a message showing the latest One America News Network/Gravis Marketing poll, which the graphic indicates is from Thursday.As shown in the collage, Clinton led Trump 51 percent to 49 percent.Clinton leads Trump by nearly six points — 44.1 percent to 38.3 percent — in the Real Clear Politics average of head-to-head national polls conducted between May 24 and Wednesday. And in POLITICOs continually updated Battleground States Polling Average, Clinton leads Trump by a similar margin, 45 percent to 40 percent.THANK YOU! #AmericaFirst pic.twitter.com/qp07UfnnjM— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2016Speaking to The New York Times on Thursday night, Trump made a rare admission that he is currently running behind his Democratic opponent.I’m four down in one poll, three and a half in another that just came out, and I haven’t started yet, Trump told the Times. And I have tremendous Republican support ... Unfortunately they never talk about that, they talk about the few rebels.Even so, Trump has said that he does not necessarily buy into the results of polls that show him losing, suggesting to his supporters that people are less likely to tell a pollster they are supporting him than they are to privately cast their vote for him.When I poll, I do fine, but when I run I do much better, Trump said at a rally in Dallas on Thursday night, summarizing what polling analysts call the Bradley effect. In other words, people say I’m not going to say who I’m voting for, don’t be embarrassed, I’m not going to say who I’m voting for and then they get it and I do much better, it’s like an amazing effect.

Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge.

Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win.

We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said in an interview Sunday he hates the concept of profiling, but at the same time is open to increasing profiling of American Muslims.In a discussion that mentioned the surveillance of American mosques and response to recent terrorist attacks, Face the Nation host John Dickerson asked Trump if he was open to having law enforcement officials single out Muslims in America.I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country, Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. Trump said it’s a concept that must be looked at seriously. He mentioned Israel and others as countries that successfully profile.We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously, he said. And other countries do it. And it’s not the worst thing to do. I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to use common sense. we’re not using common sense.Dickerson also asked Trump if Muslims should receive extra scrutiny when buying ammunition and weapons.I don’t know about that, Trump said.

I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, Wayne LaPierre said of Donald Trumps suggestion that there couldve been guns at Pulse nightclub to stop the shooter.  GettyEfforts by Democrats to introduce new gun control legislation amount to little more than a smoke screen intended to shift attention away from failed policy to combat terrorism, National Rifle Association Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said Sunday.What happened this past week is the president, the whole gun ban movement said look over here, divert your attention, take your eyes off the problem, LaPierre told John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation.They don’t want to face the embarrassment of their failure in this terrorist area, and they want to cover their butts and not talk about it.LaPierre pointed to a measure introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that would notify law enforcement should a suspected terrorist attempt to buy a weapon as an acceptable compromise, but noted concerns voiced by FBI Director James Comey that stopping a terrorist from purchasing a weapon could actually alert that terrorist that he or she is under investigation. We need to look at all our vulnerabilities and we need to harden, because they’re coming and they’re going to try to kill us and we need to be prepared, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.The NRA CEO said as far as he knew, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in broad agreement with the association’s stance.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said, arguing that terrorists in California and Paris used firearms to kills dozens of people in places with strict gun laws. He called for armed security in vulnerable targets like malls, churches and schools but stopped short of suggesting that people in bars and nightclubs, like the one where 49 people were shot in Orlando, should be carrying guns.I don’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking, he told Dickerson.Later, the NRA attempted to clarify LaPierres remarks in a post to Twitter. Its fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar that serves alcohol, the NRA wrote on LaPierres behalf, but not if you plan to drink.                  Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Fareed Zakaria: Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States?  AP PhotoRussian leader Vladimir Putin said he didnt praise presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump quite effusively as has been reported.Speaking to Fareed Zakaria during a panel discussion in St. Petersburg, Putin responded Friday to a question about his praise for Trump by saying: I only said that he was a bright person. Isn’t he bright? He is.Why do you always change the meaning of what I said? Putin asked in response to Zakarias question about Putin calling Trump brilliant.Zakaria acknowledged the word brilliant may have been a matter of imprecise translation. Putin had made the statement in December, drawing praise in return from Trump for his leadership ability.In the latest discussion, which aired Sunday on CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS, Putin did voice his approval of Trumps willingness to restore full-fledged Russian-American relations, but declined to offer additional support for Trump or anything much in the way of opinions about presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.We never interfere into the internal political processes of other countries, Putin said in his typically expressionless manner.The Russian president did take a slap at American self-righteousness toward other countries when it comes to adherence to democratic processes.Do you think that the elections are democratic in the United States? Putin asked Zakaria, adding: Twice in American history, a president was elected who did not get the majority of votes.Putin, presumably, was referring to the elections of 1876 (Rutherford Hayes) and 2000 (George W. Bush) when the candidate who received the most votes did not win in the Electoral College.Putin did acknowledge Americas status in the world: The U.S. is a great power. At the moment, it is probably the only superpower and we accept this fact.The Russian leader said he didnt think the world was sliding toward a new Cold War but did take some digs, direct and indirect, at international sanctions and NATO, which he said needed an external enemy to justify its continued existence.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan took part in the panel discussion, which also focused on topics ranging from Ukraine to Russian athletic doping scandals.                 House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.  With the Senate set to vote on competing gun control amendments Monday, Sen. Jeff Sessions said Sunday that somehow, some way, we should be able to make this work.Like many other Republicans, Sessions (R-Ala.) expressed concern that legislation banning suspected terrorists from purchasing guns might infringe on the constitutional rights of those wrongly entered onto terrorism watch lists.He told CNN’s State of the Union that he would be willing to listen to a compromise proposal being crafted by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), praising her diligence and expertise on the various terrorism watch lists and the respective thresholds for inclusion on each one.But a lot of people may be wrongly on the list. In fact, I’m sure there are a lot of people on that list that shouldn’t be on it, Sessions said, without specifying which of the various terrorism watch lists he was speaking of. So if youre going to deny a person a Constitutional right like free speech or the right to have a firearm, then that person has to have an opportunity to explain that they shouldnt be on the list. … Thats what the difference is. Republicans have voted consistently to ban people on that list from having a gun, but to give them an opportunity to prove they shouldnt be on the list. Sessions, one of the most prominent supporters of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, defended the presumptive Republican nominee’s renewed call to temporarily ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Sessions explained that his understanding of Trump’s proposal is that the ban would target nations with a history of terrorist activity and would not prohibit diplomats and business travelers from moving between those nations and the U.S. The senator referred to the proposal as a tightening of immigration policy and named Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as countries that might fall under Trump’s proposal.Sessions also attacked what he called the talking heads in the Republican Party who have steadfastly refused to fall in line behind Trump as the party’s nominee, encouraging them to read Trump’s great speech on immigration and foreign policy last week. He contrasted Trump’s remarks with those of President Barack Obama, whose response has been unbelievably weak.Finally, Sessions said he was not in discussions with the Trump campaign about the possibility of becoming the candidate’s running mate but did reiterate that he’d consider joining the ticket if asked.I only said if I were asked I would consider it. I dont expect that to happen, Sessions said. I have no idea what theyre doing. I suspect people are thinking about it, but it will be an important decision. He needs somebody who can be a great president if something happens to him, somebody who can help him advance an agenda that I think is the American peoples agenda.                 I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump said the FBI had a bad day when it didn’t follow up on a tip from a Florida gun shop owner that the gunman who killed 49 people in Orlando last weekend was acting suspiciously.The presumptive Republican nominee admitted that no system of background checks would successfully catch every terrorist looking to buy a gun, but he lamented the fact that the FBI had prior warning that an unidentified person who later turned out to be Orlando shooter Omar Mateen was acting suspiciously.This guy was, he was a bad dude. He was a bad dude. I mean, look, will somebody slip through? I guess, Trump told ABC’s This Week in an interview with Jonathan Karl. I guess the gun store owner reported him and the authorities didn’t act on it. What a shame.What does that say to you? Karl followed up.To me, it says very sad. They reported him and the authorities didn’t act, Trump replied. I think it’s very unusual. I’m a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Florida, said Thursday that an unidentified person had come to his store several weeks back and tried to buy body armor, which Abells employees said they did not have. The would-be buyer left the store, and Abell said he reported the individual to the FBI as suspicious. The person, Abell realized after the shooting, was Mateen.In his interview with Karl, taped backstage at one of Trump’s rallies this weekend in Texas, the Republican candidate renewed his promise to talk to the National Rifle Association about banning suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. The presumptive nominee wouldn’t say whether he could budge the NRA on the issue, only that he wanted to find out their thinking.What I want, and I know what they want, they want it as much as anybody in the world, they want to make sure that terrorists don’t get guns, Trump said. I know that something really good is going to come out of all of this.                 Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice will release portions of the Orlando shooter’s calls to 911 during the shooting.Attorney General Loretta Lynch will go to Orlando this week to get an on-the-ground briefing as the investigation into last weekend’s terrorist attack at a gay nightclub continues.She also plans to meet with victims, their families and first responders during her visit to the site of the massacre by Omar Mateen, which left 49 people dead. I think what’s important is to continue to keep our focus on the victims of this tragic crime as well, Lynch said Sunday on ABCs This Week. One of the things Ill do in Orlando on Tuesday is meeting with victims, talking about the support well be providing them as well. Because this is a community, the LGBT and Latino community, that has come under fire before, but never in as horrific manner as this.Lynch also said the Department of Justice will release portions of the Orlando shooter’s calls to 911 during the shooting. She said the gunman’s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State will not be included in that release, but the transcripts will shed light on his motivations for carrying out the attack.In a wave of appearances across the Sunday morning political talk shows, Lynch defended the FBI’s previous interactions with Orlando shooter Loretta Lynch and explained why a tip from a Florida gun shop owner that a person, who later turned out to be the shooter, had acted suspiciously inside the store did not yield a more thorough investigation. She told CNN’s State of the Union that because the shooter had not made a purchase inside that gun store, no identifying information had been collected.                 It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together, Donald Trump said.  GettyDonald Trump wants remaining Republicans to get on board with his campaign, but the presumptive GOP nominee says he doesn’t need them to win.Several prominent Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have lined up with varying levels of enthusiasm behind Trump. But others, like former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, have yet to throw their weight behind Trump. Some, including Mitt Romney and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have been loudly critical of their party’s nominee.But Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press that he can win in November, with or without their support.Were going to have a great convention and I think were going to go on to a great victory. It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together, he said.  I think that I win either way. I can win one way or the other.I obviously won the primaries without them, he continued. You know, Im an outsider and I won the primaries. I do believe that we can win either way, but it would be nice if we stuck together.The GOP nominee seemed unfazed by reports of a mounting effort to deny him the nomination at the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland. Characterizing it as a creation of the media, Trump scoffed at the notion that his pile of delegates could be snatched out from underneath him on the convention floor by a candidate who would like to come in through the back door.So I win 38 states and somebody else won none and they’re going to be the nominee? Trump said. I don’t think so.Trump also dismissed criticism that his campaign lacked the money and infrastructure in key battleground states to compete against the massive operation backing Democrat Hillary Clinton. The real estate mogul said he won’t need to spend as much as Clinton in order to win and added that should his campaign find itself short of funds, Trump would bankroll it on his own.She’s selling herself to Wall Street and the Wall Street fat cats are all putting up a lot of money for her. I don’t even want that kind of money, Trump said, borrowing a line of attack that Sen. Bernie Sanders used regularly against Clinton during the Democratic primary. I don’t think I need that money, frankly. I mean, look what we’re doing right now. This is like a commercial, right? Except it’s tougher than a normal commercial. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way.                 Billionaire Republican megadonor Charles Koch, pictured in 2012, gave $3 million to the Freedom Partners Action Fund.  AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.  Donald Trump has one month to pick a running mate, and Republican swing-state insiders are deeply divided over who he should choose.GOP members of The POLITICO Caucus – a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 10 key battleground states – splintered this week when asked to suggest who Trump should select to share the ticket with him this fall.Gaining the most support were former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (13 percent), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (9 percent), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (8 percent), former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (8 percent), Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst (7 percent) and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (7 percent).A plurality of Democratic and nonpartisan members see Rubio, who is reconsidering whether to retire from the Senate before next week’s filing deadline to run for reelection, as Trump’s strongest running mate. Given a list of seven possible choices, just over a third said Rubio would be Trump’s best possible pick — far more than any other individual potential candidate.For Republicans, though, the responses were a mix of serious suggestions and despair over Trump’s decision-making process and his odds in the November election.Gingrich, who left the House after the 1998 midterm elections and unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination four years ago, emerged as the narrow favorite.Hes intimately knowledgeable how Congress works and has a keen understanding of how to push the Executive Branch, said a Florida Republican, who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. Speaker Gingrich also brings the conservative credibility that should assuage some of the establishment class which is licking their wounds after being squeezed and beaten for the past year.He is excellent on his feet, added a Virginia Republican.Rubio, who has said he isn’t interested in being Trump’s running mate, was the second choice.Rubio understands public policy, hes smart, has great legislative experience, hes young, good looking and Hispanic – and women like him, said a Colorado Republican.Trump also needs Rubios expertise with regard to the politics, a Wisconsin Republican added.Rubio would be the strongest choice for Trump, Democratic insiders said, though they are confident the youthful Floridian won’t join the ticket.It is not going to happen, said a Nevada Democrat, but Rubio would have best opportunity to help Trump broaden his base.Added a North Carolina Democrat: The question is if Rubio is willing to destroy his political future for the sake of saving his party.Unlike Rubio, Kasich hasn’t even endorsed the presumptive GOP nominee – but a number of GOP insiders said they wanted him on the ticket[Trump] needs stability and Ohio, said one Virginia Republican.And Rice, the former secretary of state, was praised for her foreign policy chops – and her ability to negate a likely Trump weakness.She has everything that Trump does not, everything, said a Florida Republican.The other two potential candidates to earn significant support were Ernst, the first-term Iowa senator, and Sessions, the immigration hawk from Alabama.Ernst with her military background, genuine likeability and personality, work ethic and a quick grasp of issues would complement a Trump ticket and help in swing, purple states around the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest, said an Iowa Republican.[Ernst] has legislative experience, but she has not been in Washington long enough to be tainted, added a New Hampshire Republican.For many GOP insiders long resistant to Trump, the vice-presidential question was an opportunity to tee off on the real-estate mogul. One Iowa Republican said being Trump’s running mate was like being first mate on the Titanic.No one should have to endure that, added an Ohio Republican. No one remembers who Goldwaters running mate was, but at least that person had some honor, a New Hampshire Republican said. The one who says yes to Trump will not. It wont matter, except for the poor unfortunate soul who will gain the worlds worst resume line, said a Virginia Republican.I dont see any rational political figure accepting this suicide mission except those with an exaggerated ego and self-inflated thoughts of political superego, a Florida Republican said.Anyone willing to share the ticket with Donald Trump is unfit for the office of the vice president, insisted an Iowa Republican.There is no one Trump can pick that would make him palatable, said a Pennsylvania Republican.One area where Trump did earn some plaudits from GOP insiders: the idea of announcing his running-mate pick during next month’s national party convention in Cleveland. Fifty-nine percent of Republican insiders said that was a good idea, while 41 percent said it wasn’t, and that Trump should roll out his pick before the convention.Picking a running mate during the convention might be a PR stunt, but it could reinforce Trumps brand as going against the grain, said a Florida Republican. And only Trump has the showmanship to pull it off.Surprises are rare in politics, an Ohio Republican added. It would be beneficial.But some Republicans said Trump needs to announce his pick before Cleveland, especially with some discussing a revolt to deny him the nomination.People are talking about changing the rules to introduce another nominee. Dissatisfaction with Trump is growing among Republicans, not waning, said a New Hampshire Republican. His VP choice is all he has left if he wants any chance at all of uniting the party behind him.Weve seen this approach twice in the last three decades, added an Iowa Republican. Odd 11th-hour, manufactured drama produced Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin.One Ohio Republican suggested that approach could harm Trump’s credibility.This is not a reality show, the Republican said. I can only imagine the cut shots to the horrified faces of delegates when Sarah Palin walks out.These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this survey:Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob WitwerFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

Sen. Ron Johnson on the GOP situation: I think things remain reasonably uncertain.  APLocked in a tough fight for reelection this November, Sen. Ron Johnson said Sunday he plans to support Donald Trump for president but didnt formally endorse the presumptive nominee.There’s a big difference between the two, the Wisconsin senator explained on CNN’s State of the Union after saying he intends to support the Republican nominee.Well to me, he told Dana Bash, endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything, Johnson said. Thats not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I’ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. Ill voice it, whether its Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else.Trump’s controversial candidacy could spell trouble for Johnson this fall, who faces a stiff challenge from former Sen. Russ Feingold, whom Johnson ousted in 2010. A recent Marquette University Law School poll shows Johnson trailing Feingold, 51 percent to 42 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters.Johnson was not willing to dismiss the notion that Trump’s nomination might come undone at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland even though Trump would seem to have more than enough delegates. He said that while he’s not a part of any movement to deny Trump the GOP nomination, nobody can really predict whats going to be the outcome of our nomination process.He also made that point about unpredictability in discussing his support for Trump: It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee. And again nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. So I think things remain reasonably uncertain.                 Sen.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee. But even many prominent Mormons who say they are voting for Trump have little appetite for helping him tap into their community and to broader Republican circles.I plan, at this point, to vote for him. That’s maybe the extent of it, said Bruce Woodbury, a prominent Clark County Republican and leader in the Mormon community, who was very active on behalf of Romney. Woodbury, who has been a delegate to the last six national conventions, won’t be a delegate in Cleveland.Trump’s fraught relationship with the LDS community starts at the top: Romney has been one of the GOP’s most persistent and vocal critics of the nominee. During the GOP primary, Trump questioned the sincerity of Romney’s faith and consistently lost parts of the country with heavy Mormon populations — like eastern Idaho and Utah.Recent general election polls out of heavily Mormon, deep-red Utah have newly underscored Trump’s broader challenge with the community—a community that is troubled by, among other things, his hostile language toward Hispanic immigrants (many Mormons do missions to South America) and his waffling on social issues. The LDS church, which itself suffered much discrimination in the past, released a statement in December saying, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns. However, it is not neutral in relation to religious freedom. The statement came as Trump pushed a proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration. According to the recent most recent Utah poll, Trump is deadlocked with Hillary Clinton in Utah — in a state that hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1964.I cannot go there, said Heidi Wixom, a Nevada Mormon and GOP activist well-respected in the community, of voting for Trump. Pointing to the list of incendiary comments he has made about other minority groups, she continued, Belonging to a church that has felt persecution, you wonder, will his rhetoric continue on? What happens to a group of people he sees aren’t supportive of him? What would he do to them?Trump’s Mormon issue may be felt acutely in a swing state like Nevada. Despite twice voting for Barack Obama, it’s still considered a November battleground. Trump ran well there in the Nevada caucuses but he’ll need an energized base to push him over the finish line. Enthusiastic LDS backing alone won’t be enough to win the state—as Romney demonstrated—but the chilly reception Trump is receiving from top community leaders could help ensure that Nevada stays blue.Wixom said that she spoke with around 40 fellow LDS Republicans in Nevada on Thursday.

They’re not supporting at large. They’re tolerating and voting. They’re not going to be putting Trump signs in the yards, they’re not going to be rallying around phone calls, they’re not going to help with grassroots efforts.But it’s still early, stressed Ira Hansen, a Mormon Republican assemblyman and the assistant majority floor leader, adding that he expects the community to eventually embrace Trump—at least enough to help him over the finish line. That’s what Hansen did after his favored candidate, Ted Cruz, dropped out.I think we’ll find, when push comes to shove, his platform comes out, a lot of people will rally around, in the LDS community and elsewhere, Hansen said, noting that a solid vice presidential pick and more details on Supreme Court choices could further smooth that path.He went on to add, It’s way premature to start determining what people are going to start doing in August, September, October. The reality is, we haven’t had a convention, we don’t know who the picks are going to be as far as vice president, the Supreme Court, a lot of things that could make a dramatic turnaround.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment and questions about Trump’s Mormon outreach efforts.Plenty of Mormon leaders are adamant that even if Trump eventually gets their votes, he won’t get much of their time.I’m most likely to vote Trump, Christensen said.

Donald Trump will head to Nevada on Saturday, but some of the most committed local Republicans won’t be rolling out the welcome mat for his Las Vegas rally.Nevada Mormons, a relatively small but influential bloc within the state party, are struggling to get comfortable with the GOP nominee. And in contrast to previous years — especially 2012, when fellow Mormon Mitt Romney led the Republican ticket — many leaders in the Latter-day Saints community have no interest in activating their extensive networks and grassroots infrastructure on his behalf.The result: Trump is facing an organizational disadvantage compared to previous GOP candidates, as well as an enthusiasm gap with an important GOP constituency in a key swing state.Usually our people are very involved in being engaged, trying to get other people engaged, said Cory Christensen, a GOP operative active in the LDS community, who hasn’t decided yet whether to support Trump. Some very significant, key people that are seen as political leaders—that aren’t elected officials but everybody knows they are involved, and look to them for advice—those people are not making the calls, doing the work, selling people on the fact that they need to be with him. That’s where the big impact would be felt.Mormons comprise only around 4 percent of the state’s population, according to a 2014 Pew study, but there’s a significant LDS concentration in Clark County, Nevada’s population hub. Many of the most prominent Republican leaders in the state, including Sen. Dean Heller and Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, are Mormon, and the LDS community typically has considerable reach in driving overall Republican turnout, operatives on the ground say.That is an essential part of the Republican coalition in Nevada, and Republicans don’t win without enthusiastic support from the LDS community in Nevada, said a Nevada conservative leader who is not affiliated with the LDS church. If he is unable to engender the kind of enthusiasm he needs from that community, he’s not going to win. You need that infrastructure. You need those folks out there actively excited about it as well.Heller has said he is vehemently opposed to Trump, while Hutchison, who endorsed Marco Rubio in the Nevada caucuses, has made lukewarm comments about backing the nominee.

Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls by increasing margins, Donald Trump dug himself a deeper hole with his response to the shootings in Orlando, Fla., this week.That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 10 key battleground states. Large majorities in both parties are convinced Trump struck the wrong chords in his public statements and Twitter posts after a gunman shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub early Sunday morning.A combined 72 percent of GOP insiders said Trump’s response to the incident was only fair or poor — with nearly half of all Republicans rating it poor. Only 8 percent said Trump’s response was excellent, and 20 percent rated it good.Among Democratic insiders, it was virtually unanimous: 99 percent rated Trump’s response as poor. The other 1 percent chose only fair.Republicans’ main objection? Trump’s seemingly self-congratulatory tweets in which he said people were giving him credit for predicting the rise of terrorist attacks in the U.S.Only an a--hole says ‘I told you so’ the same day 49 people are killed on American soil by a terrorist, said a New Hampshire Republican, who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. And only an a--hole would really believe Trump predicted or understood something unique — everyone who knows anything at all about whats happening has warned against the potential terror that can be unleashed by homegrown extremists.This issue should play right into his hand and be devastating against Hillary [Clinton], added a Pennsylvania Republican, but Trump made it all about his handling of it and not about the actual national security impact.A number of Republicans also cited Trump’s insinuation that President Barack Obama was somehow complicit in the murders.This was his chance to be himself and turn this election in his favor, and he instead introduced a new conspiracy theory suggesting the president knew something of the attack before it happened, an Iowa Republican said. 9/11 and Pearl Harbor-truthers rejoice! Your candidate has arrived!Some Republicans were more receptive to Trump’s response, crediting him for his criticism of the Obama administration for its approach to terrorism at home and abroad.Better the idiocy of Trump who can at least name the threat than the ignorance and incompetence of Obama/Clinton whose refusal to confront radical Islam puts us all in more danger every day, said an Ohio Republican.He has the right position, but says it completely wrong, a Florida Republican added. He doesnt realize that hes in the general election and is still running as if hes in a Republican primary.And one New Hampshire Republican gave Trump credit for trying to appeal to the gay community following the attacks — though the Republican faulted his execution.He was smart to make a play for the LGBT community — he just shouldnt have been so ham-handed about it, said the New Hampshire Republican.A few GOP insiders were unnerved by his suggestion later in the week that he’d be open to discussing tightening the nation’s gun laws.First response YES! exclaimed an Iowa Republican. Now with his change of heart on guns, I dont know how I feel.Another Iowa Republican hated both reactions, however: A d--- response of ‘I was right,’ now pivoting to support for gun control — denying American citizens due process before taking away constitutional rights.The universally negative response from Democratic insiders cited many of the same reasons: Trump’s apparent self-congratulation, and his intimations about Obama’s role.Poor doesnt even begin to describe it, said a Florida Democrat. Offensive. Wrong. Disqualifying. As a gay man from Florida, who has spent many nights with friends dancing at Pulse, the attack hit very close to home. Before knowing if my friends or family members were among the victims, Donald Trump was making it about himself. While I was praying for those who died, Trump was seeking to divide us rather than heal the nation.Ultimately, Trump’s response left some Republican insiders even more despondent about the party’s apparent nominee.For those who think Trump is sabotaging himself because he secretly doesnt want to be [president], said a Colorado Republican, they will find further evidence in his response to the tragedy in Orlando.I wish there was a category below ‘poor,’ one Virginia Republican said. Like ‘Unworthy of a Great Republic.’ Or ‘An Embarrassment to All That is Decent and Good.’These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this survey:Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob WitwerFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team. But it took a perfect storm for Edwards to triumph in 2015, and there doesn’t appear to be a GOP candidate in the race with Vitter’s personal, party label-defying vulnerabilities.Visit the Campaign Pro Race Dashboard to track the candidates and consulting firms engaged in the top House, Senate, and gubernatorial races of 2016. Democrats hope, and Republicans fear, that Donald Trump is tilting the Senate battleground map away from the GOP in 2016. But the biggest wild card in the race for Senate control is Marco Rubio.Calls for Rubio to run for his Florida Senate seat again, reversing his decision to forego reelection when he ran for president in 2015, have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera — a GOP candidate and friend of Rubio’s — joining pleas from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top party leaders. Republicans have grown concerned that their primary field seeking to replace Rubio did not have what it took to win the 10-week general election sprint after the late August primary.Rubio, with his national reputation and fundraising connections, would ease those concerns — though he likely wouldn’t guarantee a Republican victory. Florida is still a tightly divided state, and the bulk of the Senate map is set, though Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is tilting some races.Strategists wonder whether Trump might just help the GOP in less-diverse states like New Hampshire and Missouri, while Republicans running in regions with significant shares of Latino and other minority voters may have more electoral backlash to fear.Democrats remain confident about defeating Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, while the presidential swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada make up the core of the map. They’re followed by a trio of second-tier states — North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona — as well as Colorado, which is technically a GOP pickup opportunity despite the Republican field’s weaknesses there.Yet despite their Trump troubles, Republicans do have some advantages of their own. Their well-funded outside groups have put Democrats on defense from Wisconsin to Ohio to New Hampshire, where they have already put millions of dollars behind attack ads.Rubio has until June 24, Florida’s filing deadline, to make his decision. In the meantime, here are the 2016 Senate races, ranked in order of each seat’s likelihood of switching parties in November: 1. Illinois — GOP Sen. Mark Kirk running for reelection (Previous ranking: 1)Kirk is ensconced at the top of this list, and there may be little his campaign can to do to change that, given his state’s Democratic lean. Democratic nominee Tammy Duckworth shrugged off a primary challenge in March, and the three-term congresswoman has more money in her campaign account. Most notably, GOP super PACs have left Illinois off their early target lists for outside spending.Against that backdrop, Kirk’s campaign has hammered on a personalized issue rather than a national one: Duckworth’s upcoming trial, a civil lawsuit filed by her former employees at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Kirk also got significant attention for un-endorsing Trump, who is likely to lose Illinois by a huge margin. But Kirk will have to keep balancing between keeping base Republicans and moderate swing voters happy for the rest of the campaign.2. Wisconsin — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson running for reelection (2)Johnson is running a strong campaign, but the fact remains that even the best effort might not be enough to offset Wisconsin’s blue lean in presidential years, as well as Democrat Russ Feingold’s name-identification advantage. While a few surveys have shown Johnson within the margin of error, Feingold has led every single public poll so far.Feingold also continues to outraise the incumbent Republican. He has $6.4 million on hand to Johnson’s $5.5 million. But unlike Kirk, Johnson already has plenty of help from GOP outside groups, with more likely coming. Ads from groups in the Koch network have put Feingold on the defensive about his record on veterans’ issues, and the Club for Growth is also prepared to spend heavily to help Johnson. Two super PACs dedicated to Johnson’s candidacy exist, and one has already begun airing ads.Johnson is essentially attempting to paint Feingold as the incumbent. His first ad of the campaign focused on his business experience, without a single mention of his record in the Senate. Republican releases routinely put Ron Johnson against Senator Feingold. But the labels that may matter most, Democrat and Republican, put Johnson at a disadvantage.3. Florida — Open, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio retired to run for president (4)Republicans are begging Rubio to run for reelection — to the point that GOP leaders are even sabotaging their own primary field to make the case. National Republicans believe the existing field of Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, and businessmen Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox doesn’t include a candidate who has shown what it takes to run a statewide race in Florida.At the same time, outside Republicans are ecstatic with the number they’ve done on Democrats’ preferred candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, over the last few weeks. They’ve caught him embellishing his resume and unspooled reels of opposition research to portray him as privileged Patrick. Murphy also still must bypass Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary. Grayson has ethical issues galore, but can also outflank Murphy on the left on any number of issues. President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Murphy is likely to be key.If Rubio reenters the contest, it’d be easy to see this race fall in the rankings. But with opposition to Trump likely to drive turnout among the state’s plentiful African American and Hispanic voters, an open Florida Senate seat now looks more likely to end up in Democratic hands than New Hampshire’s.4. New Hampshire — GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte running for reelection (3)Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan are running neck-and-neck, and operatives on both sides expect that to persist through the fall. Ayotte’s relationship to Trump is one to watch: Trump won her state’s primary by a huge margin, but Ayotte has reportedly spoken up about the problems Trump generates for down-ballot candidates behind closed doors.Ayotte’s team has also been aggressive in attacking Hassan over a sex-abuse scandal at the prep school where her husband served as headmaster and for taking trips out of the state to raise cash. GOP outside groups have attacked Hassan relentlessly; One Nation recently started airing ads hitting the governor for not doing more to tackle the state’s heroin epidemic.New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country, isn’t the type of state where Trump totally ruins GOP hopes. But Ayotte’s reelection bid against another popular statewide elected official was always going to be an uphill fight, and Senate Majority PAC has already started tying Ayotte to Trump in TV ads.5. Pennsylvania — GOP Sen. Pat Toomey running for reelection (5)Toomey, a favorite of the Koch network, the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth, looks set to get help from the full breadth of the GOP coalition. Those outside groups also believe they can define Democrat Katie McGinty using everything from her long career in government and consulting to a recent false claim that she was the first member of her family to go to college. Democratic outside groups have had to buck her up, from the DSCC’s big primary spending to a recent (and rare) contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC.But Democrats are still optimistic: Republicans haven’t won Pennsylvania on the presidential level in decades, and they believe attacking Toomey for Wall Street ties (the other half of that Senate Majority PAC ad) will be potent come November.Toomey has also been among the more careful Republicans when it comes to Trump, writing a skeptical op-ed after he clinched the nomination that could make breaking with his ticket easier if such a move proves necessary.6. Ohio — GOP Sen. Rob Portman running for reelection (7)Ohio might be the epitome of the 2016 Senate campaigns. Portman, who has $13 million in the bank, is a well funded GOP incumbent. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who has struggled to raise money and whose long tenure in government makes him an opposition researcher’s dream, has struggled somewhat as a Senate candidate.And there’s lot of Democratic optimism, because Clinton is favored to beat Trump in a state Democrats have won twice in a row on the presidential level. Strickland’s campaign has also zeroed in on Portman’s long pro-trade history, which could become a wedge issue for voters drawn to Trump’s America first positioning.But Portman’s campaign has made massive investments in data, digital and field, which it hopes to use to peel off Clinton voters one at a time by highlighting Strickland’s jobs record as governor and his support for the Iran nuclear deal.7. Nevada — Open, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid retiring (6)Former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is running to be the first Latina ever elected to the Senate, a potent message in a year where Hispanic voters are expected to flock to the polls to reject Trump. Her first television ads have put the focus on her large Hispanic family and her father’s immigrant-to-riches story. But her campaign has been cautious on policy, relying on demographics and biography to lift her over the top.GOP Rep. Joe Heck looks set to easily clear a Tuesday primary challenge from Sharron Angle, the 2010 nominee who ruined GOP hopes of winning this seat six years ago. But this race has slipped down the flip list because its demographics were already bad news for Republicans — and Trump looks set to make the situation worse.8. North Carolina — GOP Sen. Richard Burr running for reelection (10)North Carolina was a Senate afterthought earlier this year, but its diversity is prompting Democrats to give Burr’s seat a fresh look as they figure out their fall priorities. Priorities USA’s $9 million buy in the state is evidence of that, and Burr has low name identification. Democrats believe the Senate race is within the margin of error.                            Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain both are at risk of losing their seats in November.  AP PhotoBut Deborah Ross, the Democratic candidate, may need all the help she can get. Republicans believe they could make attack ads out of practically every action she took as former chair of the state ACLU. The NRSC debuted an attack ad on cable last weekend slamming Ross for work[ing] to prevent sex offenders from registering with local authorities.9. Missouri — GOP Sen. Roy Blunt running for reelection (9)Democrats like their candidate in Missouri: They say Afghanistan vet and Secretary of State Jason Kander provides a solid contrast to Blunt, a longtime politician. And some Republicans worry Blunt isn’t running the sharpest campaign.But Missouri is also a state that has been trending away from Democrats nationally, unlike North Carolina. Kander, on paper, is a better candidate than Ross. But Democrats are increasingly concerned that demographics may negate any edge that might provide. 10. Arizona — GOP Sen. John McCain running for reelection (11)Latino-heavy Arizona is a prime example of a state where Trump endangers Republicans — and McCain has admitted as much. On the flip side, the key to surviving an anti-Trump wave would be developing a personal brand, and there may not be a single senator as well-known as McCain, the original maverick. Fellow Republicans believe McCain should easily brush aside a primary challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, though McCain’s super PAC has had to spend money opposing her.Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick broke $1 million for the first time in a quarter in the first three months of the year, but also spent about $600,000 far ahead of her expensive fall battle with McCain. Overall, Democrats have been pleased with her performance on the trail and think she’s in position to ride an anti-Trump wave, should one crest in November.11. Colorado — Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet running for reelection (8)Five Republicans are battling for a chance to take on Bennet, who has $7.6 million in the bank, but they all lag in fundraising, name ID or both. And national Republicans are beginning to lose hope they can unseat the incumbent, whose favorability numbers are weaker than ideal.Businessman Robert Blaha and former Colorado State University athletic director Jack Graham, both first-time candidates, have both poured in $1 million of their own money into their campaigns to introduce themselves to the state, while former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn have all struggled to raise resources. Blaha, Keyser and Frazier also nearly failed to make the primary ballot, having to rely on legal action to secure their spots. Meanwhile, Bennet has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on positive ads boosting his image.12. Iowa — GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley running for reelection (unranked)Grassley was once considered invincible, and he still may be — but he’s watching his back. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats thought they could turn his obstruction of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee into a defining issue in the race and recruited Democratic Lt. Gov. Patty Judge. So far, there’s no polling to indicate Judge is on the verge of a massive upset, and Democrats believe she needs to raise more money to have a real shot. But in a state Obama won twice, it’s not hard to imagine how this race could get competitive.13. Kentucky — GOP Sen. Rand Paul running for reelection (14)The national Republicans who fretted about Paul’s reelection while he was running for president have calmed down. Democrats have also found a solid candidate in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who has impressed them with a combination of self-funding and fundraising. But GOP Gov. Matt Bevin’s easy win in 2015 shows it will take some major mistakes from Paul for Gray to have a shot.14. Arkansas — GOP Sen. John Boozman running for reelection (13) Boozman was yet another candidate national Republicans worried about last fall, but he has picked up his fundraising and silenced complainers in D.C. Like Paul, he faces a legitimate candidate in former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge, who has picked his spots bringing national attention to the race. Former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor’s huge defeat in 2014 was a sobering experience for Arkansas Democrats, though.15. Louisiana — Open, GOP Sen. David Vitter retiring (15) National operatives in both parties admit they are paying little attention to this contest, which is almost certainly heading to a runoff after Election Day. Republicans have four legitimate candidates: Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, retired Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy. Kennedy has led early polling thanks to a major name ID advantage, but there are some doubts he can legally move money from a state account to a super PAC, a key part of his campaign strategy. Local Democrats are looking to coalesce around Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who has the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards — and has reassembled much of his campaign team.

AP PhotoDonald Trump says he isnt worried about delegates organizing against him at the Republican National Convention next month — but he spent a large part of his rally in Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon insisting that it wont happen.The presumptive Republican nominee, speaking from the Treasure Island hotel and casino, insisted that the story is all made up by the press. Its a hoax.POLITICO reported on Friday the efforts by dozens of anti-Trump delegates to block Trump from securing the GOP nomination in Cleveland. Republican National Committee officials and party leaders have dismissed the idea that someone other than Trump could be the nominee, but the effort is one of the most significant to come together since the Republican primary ended.Who are they going to pick? I beat everybody, Trump said. I beat the hell out of them. And we’re going to beat Hillary.Trump continued: And it’d be helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit. Trump also suggested that if Republicans don’t unite behind him, he’ll move forward by funding his own campaign.If they don’t want to help out as much, I’ll fund my own campaign, he said. Id love to do that.Continuing to fund his own campaign, Trump said, would be the easy way to go about raising money.I’ll just keep doing what I’m doing, he said.                 At every turn, Donald Trump has defied the hopes and expectations of those who believed he wouldn’t run.  AP PhotoHow much would it cost to get Donald Trump to give up his presidential run and walk away?I bet if someone offered him $150 million to drop out, he would, one former Trump adviser told POLITICO, unprompted, during an interview Friday.Asked about whether Trump would drop out, another former Trump adviser, Jim Dornan said he believes the presumptive GOP nominee would be willing to cut a deal. Yeah, probably, Dornan, a veteran Republican operative who worked for Trump last spring on an abortive effort to set up a super PAC, replied via text message — adding there would be plenty of interest in buying him out. The Kochs would be the first in line.Trump himself says it’s a ridiculous proposition and that he’s not a fan of the question.This story is a total fabrication from you and POLITICO, as usual, the New York billionaire said in an email sent by his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. I will never leave the race, nobody has enough money to pay me to leave the race, and if they did, it would be totally illegal anyway. Did Obama and the Clintons get you to write this garbage?Indeed, it would be an unprecedented move for a presumptive major party nominee to drop out of a presidential race, for money or otherwise. It also seems extremely improbable that Trump, after a full year of campaigning and putting millions into his campaign, would walk away right before claiming the prize after having bested 16 rivals for the nomination.But even if it is only a fantasy, its a popular one. When the former adviser’s $150 million postulation was posted on Twitter, it sparked a social media flurry, with intense interest from anti-Trump Republicans and liberals alike. The wishful thinking of many political observers eager to entertain the far-fetched scenario reflects the still-growing fears among Republican elites about Trump’s potential to damage the party, the growing desperation among some Republican elites for an alternative to Trump or Hillary Clinton, and the persistence of doubts about Trump’s commitment to the race that have dogged his candidacy from the start.At every turn, Trump has defied the hopes and expectations of those who believed he wouldn’t run, wouldn’t file a personal financial disclosure, or would drop out before the first primary votes were cast. And following weeks in which Trump took a tumble in the polls and infuriated many in his own party with attacks on the heritage of a Mexican-American judge and response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, hope for some sort of deus ex machina salvation from Trump springs eternal.Done.

Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together.                 House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans on taking back his endorsement of Donald Trump.  GettyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says it’s his responsibility to support Donald Trump, even if the presumptive Republican nominee’s bombast occasionally makes him uncomfortable. Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election. I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House, Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House, he continued. I don’t want to see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. As he has often done when pressed to respond to Trump’s controversial rhetoric, Ryan framed his support for the presumptive nominee as the best way to ensure that his newly rolled-out slate of conservative policy proposals finds an ally in the White House. Ryan had hoped that those proposals, focusing on issues like poverty, national security and tax reform, would bring substance to the 2016 race. Thus far, Trump’s bluster has kept Ryan’s package of proposals from gaining much traction on the campaign trail. Ryan refused to engage in hypotheticals when Todd asked whether he would feel the same responsibility to support Trump if he were not speaker of the House. Ryan, who will serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, also declined to weigh in on the possibility of rules changes that could deny Trump the nomination by freeing delegates of their obligation to vote for him. On gun control, the speaker warned against a rush to legislation that might infringe Americans’ constitutional rights in the wake of the recent massacre in Orlando, Florida. Ryan said the House is paying attention to the ongoing debate over gun control in the Senate and also to warnings from the FBI to be careful that any new law banning suspected terrorists from purchasing a weapon does not end up interfering with terror investigations. Let’s also not, in the haste of the moment, compromise a person’s legitimate Second Amendment rights. And let’s make sure that law enforcement has the tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun that they’re not supposed to get a gun, Ryan said. There are a lot of issues that needed attending to that deal with these violent actions. But taking away a legitimate, law-abiding citizen’s Second Amendment rights, I don’t think is the right move to make.  Donald Trump has vowed to remake the electoral map by winning states that have been reliably blue in recent cycles — but the GOP’s best pollsters say his bluster is a long way from aligning with reality.Trump, who has been slow to campaign in swing states while raising money in stumping in red states like Texas last week, should be able to count on winning Republican strongholds — states such as Arizona (11 Electoral College votes) and Georgia (16), where he campaigned last Wednesday, despite some optimism from Democrats that those increasingly diverse states could be put in play. In total, the party’s electoral math gurus say the presumptive GOP nominee likely starts the general election with a hold on 19 states, which give him a total of 164 Electoral College votes.To reach 270, Trump’s team is aiming to capture America’s Rust Belt — specifically, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin — where polls generally show him performing better than Mitt Romney did at this point in 2012. If he can capture Florida and keep North Carolina — the 2012 red state of the lightest hue — a strong showing that includes capture of the Rust Belt could, Trump’s team believes, put him over the top.But the odds are long, veteran strategists said.It’s a fantasy. Romney got 19 percent of nonwhites. Is Trump going to do better? I don’t think so, said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s 2012 campaign strategist. It’s a joke. It’s just talking. It has no grounding in reality.Trump, however, is looking even farther afield. He is talking up his chances in states like New York and California and making tactical moves aimed at boosting his support in states no Republican presidential hopeful has won since the 1980s.Despite being the only candidate left standing in the GOP field, Trump campaigned for three weeks in California, contending that he can take the state’s 55 electoral votes away from Hillary Clinton in November. And while his campaign has yet to hire a state director in Ohio, Trump recently brought on John McLaughlin, a New York pollster, to help him win his home state — even though polls show Clinton ahead by more than 20 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.On Thursday, Trump reportedly told donors during a meeting that he thinks he can put New Jersey and Maryland in play as well. Plus, a super PAC backing him is tossing money into national cable ads rather than targeting voters in the battlegrounds.But the consensus of the Republican political and polling world outside Trump Tower is that he cannot expect to make such dramatic inroads; most pollsters say this unpredictable election cycle has not changed the fundamental electoral math, even as it has taught the most seasoned observers to expect the unexpected.Never in modern history have we seen two nominees who have an unfavorable rating over 50 percent, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Washington. We’re truly in uncharted waters trying to use history to determine what’s going to happen in this campaign.Those close to his campaign privately say Trump’s pronouncements about turning some strongly Democratic states is essentially an old-fashioned head fake — an effort to raise money while forcing Clinton’s team to spend its own defending safe territory.He’s just poking and prodding to see if he can put [California] in play, said one operative who works closely with the campaign. He doesn’t have to win but would love to make her spend some money and time there.But he will need to outperform Romney to win, and there is no underestimating the difficulty of that task.With the exception of Wisconsin, where Trump suffered one of his worst primary losses, the Rust Belt states his team has identified appear to be competitive, although current polls are somewhat misleading, taken at a moment when Clinton has yet to bring home disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to unify Republicans for more than a month.Right now, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida look very close because she’s having a hard time getting Sanders supporters on board, said Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, whose most recent surveys show Clinton with a 1 percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania and a 3-point edge in Ohio.Republicans are more unified right now than Democrats, he continued. Trump’s lead with Republicans [in Pennsylvania] was 12 points bigger than her lead with Democrats, but it remains to be seen if that can be sustained. One thing we saw is that 72 percent of Sanders supporters say they’d vote for Clinton over Trump — and if she gets just half of them, her lead balloons to around 6 or 7 points.It’s a similar situation in Florida, where PPP’s most recent survey, taken last week, showed Trump with a 1-point lead but Clinton with far more room to increase support from her own party.With Colorado and Virginia trending Democratic in recent cycles and Nevada and other states with high Hispanic populations a long shot for Trump, Pennsylvania is increasingly viewed as Trump’s best pickup chance — the state that, provided he wins Ohio and Florida, could get him to 270. But even with strong support from working-class whites in the western part of the state and conservatives in central Pennsylvania’s T region, Trump’s only chance of pulling the upset rests on his ability to broaden his support in the voter-rich collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Romney lost in 2012 by 14 points.Trump won the Pennsylvania primary but saw his vote total in those swing suburban counties come in 25 points lower than his support in the western part of the state that borders Appalachia, where he won close to 8 in 10 votes in some places.For him to win here, he really needs to do better in the suburban counties, and he’s underperforming based on our numbers from where he needs to be, said Jim Lee, a pollster based in Harrisburg. These voters are more socially moderate, even though they’re largely Republican in registration; and Trump’s positions on immigration are problematic for a lot of these suburban swing voters.There are at least a few reasons for Trump to think he can do better than Romney in Pennsylvania, which has the sixth oldest population in the country.For the lean-Democratic voter, Romney wasn’t good enough for them to move away from Obama, said David Flaherty, whose firm, Magellan Strategies, has done polling in Pennsylvania. But especially with older, Catholic white voters, Trump’s talk about trade policy is hitting home, so there is more of an opportunity — in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The other thing working in his favor is that younger voters aren’t as enthused about Hillary as they were for Obama.Trump’s issue portfolio may give him an opening in Michigan, a state Romney lost despite being the son of a former governor. But a Detroit News poll earlier this month showed Clinton already 5 points ahead. Fair trade versus free trade is a very hot issue in Michigan with all the manufacturing, said Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who said a Trump win there is a heavy lift but not impossible. I think his ‘America First’ approach, his trade policies, his building a wall play well in a labor state that’s concerned about jobs.Trump will probably do better amongst Reagan Democrats, African-Americans and blue-collar workers than Romney did, he continued. But Romney probably did better with independents than Trump will.But the other Great Lakes state Trump’s team is eyeing, Wisconsin, is a poor bet, Republicans pollsters say. Trump was defeated badly in the April primary there and the most recent survey shows Clinton with a seven-point lead.The southeast part of the state around Milwaukee and all those suburban counties are typically where we see massive Republican turnout in normal elections, and these voters went enormously against Trump in the primary and had enormously negative views, reinforced by talk radio, said Marquette University’s Charles Franklin, widely recognized as the best pollster in the state. And those folks remain quite critical of him. That’s why the party here has really had a hard time rallying around him.A stronger showing than Romney’s with white voters may not be enough to guarantee a Trump win in Florida, where Hispanics account for 15 percent or more of likely Election Day turnout and are likely to be highly motivated to vote against Trump based largely on his strong anti-illegal immigration stance.You can turn out every ‘Bubba’ in North Florida for a month, you’re not going to get there, said Florida GOP operative Rick Wilson, who has been vehemently anti-Trump and sounding alarms about an electoral blowout from the get-go. Add up the 23 counties in the Panhandle, and it’s [equal to] Broward and Dade [counties]. Seventy-two percent of Hispanics here disapprove of Trump. There’s no magical thinking that gets you home if you’ve got a guy who calls Hispanics rapists or says a Hispanic judge is unqualified to sit on a case you’re involved in. The racism is the centerpiece of his campaign, and it’s just not a winning electoral strategy in this environment.Trump is wrapping up a nine-day cross-country tour over the weekend that included his first visits to general-election swing states since wrapping up the nomination more than five weeks ago. But because the schedule was largely determined based on fundraising opportunities, Trump spent an abundance of time in red states like Texas, Georgia and Arizona.Trump’s operation, which brought on its first pollster just last month, recognizes that the presumptive nominee needs a successful Republican National Convention next month to better position himself for a general election fight that currently looks like a steep uphill climb.We will be very interested to see where this race stands after the conventions, said one Trump campaign source familiar with the team’s research and general election battle plan. There is a genuine thirst for an outsider and a total change of direction. Question will be, can we capitalize on it while allaying any concerns without losing our edge. Hillary Clinton’s super PAC has begun spending $145 million on ads in eight states through November — and there’s a realistic path for her to win the White House even if she carries only one of them.It’s a sign of how strongly tilted the Electoral College map is in Clinton’s favor, as she begins a general election campaign building upon the demographic and geographic coalition that President Obama rode to two electoral landslides. Donald Trump, in contrast, must dramatically reimagine and redraw the political landscape to capture the presidency.Rather than expand the 2012 map in any significant way, the Clinton campaign and its allies want to replicate it. They are obsessed with choking off Trump’s narrower path, hoping to strike a decisive victory in Florida — multiple Clinton officials declared there is nearly no path for Trump without it — while aggressively defending the Democratic-leaning states in the industrial Midwest that Trump has talked most about flipping — most importantly, Pennsylvania. Campaign officials say they think Clinton can turn out more female voters than Obama did. But they see one surrogate in particular as key to recreating the Obama coalition: President Barack Obama himself.Clinton has a multitude of paths, as her allies and advisers see it. Trump has a single route: ginning up disaffected, non-college educated, working-class white voters -- many whom may never have voted before -- to sweep across the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.I dont think he has anything outside a Rust Belt theory, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the Clinton campaign. Clinton allies also note that Trump is an organization-lite candidate who is driven by message, but, they argue, that is a risky strategy for getting out people who typically don’t vote.Clinton’s top campaign officials note there are 19 states that have voted Democratic in each of the last six presidential elections that account for a total of 242 electoral-college votes. Add in New Mexico, whose population is 40 percent Latino and which has gone Democratic in five of the past six contests, and that is 247 of the 270 votes needed to get to the White House.It’s a massive, massive electoral advantage, said Mitch Stewart, who served as battleground-states director for Obama in 2012 and who estimated that Republicans begin 2016 with closer to 191 mostly safe electoral votes. Even if you take out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, it’s basically like a Florida headstart.Collectively, the solid Democratic states since 1992 have become known as the blue wall, and if Clinton wins them and adds only Florida and its 29 electoral votes among the traditional battlegrounds, it’s enough to become president.That means Clinton could conceivably win the White House while losing Ohio (18 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Iowa (6) — all states that Obama carried twice, besides North Carolina, which he won only in 2008. Those are the seven states, along with Florida, that Clinton’s super PAC is advertising in. And with Trump’s heated rhetoric about Hispanics, Democrats see their support consolidating in fast-growing and increasingly Latino western states such as Nevada and Colorado.What remains true today, like it did in 2008 and 2012, is that we have many more pathways to get to 270 than Donald Trump, said the Clinton campaign official.The urgent task for Trump, then, is to bust up the blue wall. So far, his campaign has signaled it is focused on most seriously contesting three of its states: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20) and Wisconsin (10). In Trump’s defense, the notion of a blue wall is more a historical artifact than a predictive map, and the idea that parts of it could crumble is not nearly as far-fetched as many Democrats would like to believe.Pennsylvania, for instance, was the sixth-closest state in 2012, with Obama winning by 5.4 percent — a smaller margin than so-called battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. And unlike other states with booming Latino populations that are becoming more Democratic, the Cook Political Report recently calculated that Pennsylvania has been trending Republican, driven by western Pennsylvania’s conservative tilt.Notably, Trump and Clinton are campaigning in the Pittsburgh area on their first campaign swings since the former secretary of state became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even as Trump pushes to steal back some recent blue states, he is stuck protecting his flank — Republican states that Clinton could hope to peel off through a combination of the presumptive GOP nominees incendiary anti-Latino rhetoric and demographic shifts. The first is North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and which was the second-closest state in 2012. In a bad sign for Trump, Clinton’s super PAC announced a $9 million TV buy there on Friday, slated to run through Election Day. The others are Arizona and Georgia.Trump will campaign in all three of those states during the nine-day swing state tour he began Friday. (Trump has also flirted with completely ignoring the traditional political map, wanting to compete in New York, for instance, even hiring pollster John McLaughlin to survey a state that gave Obama his fourth-biggest margin of victory in the country in 2012.)Among the traditional battlegrounds, the swing state that Democrats believe leans most in Clinton’s direction is Colorado, which strategists says offers a toxic demographic mix for Trump.Colorado has an influx of young people, a growing Latino population and a highly educated population — all of which are brutal for Trump, said Craig Hughes, who was a senior adviser for Obama’s two campaigns there. Colorado got tipping-point status in 2008 and 2012 but in 2016 it leans more left.The battleground state Clinton allies most fear falling into GOP hands seems to be Ohio. Obama, the thinking goes, more or less maxed out the African-American vote there. Mitt Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout drove down his numbers among working-class whites. And Trump has unique appeal to those voters, while Clinton has less room to grow in a state Obama carried by less than 3 percent in 2012.Ohio will be the most challenging, Stewart predicted.Clinton’s flash points of concern are her inability during the primary to energize millennial voters – even young women – who flocked to Bernie Sanders. The only scenario to lose is Trump consolidates the Republican base, Sanders people and young people dont come out to vote, and he overperforms among white voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire — all disproportionately white, said one veteran Democratic strategist with ties to the Clintons.The Clinton campaign recognizes her weakness among working-class whites, particularly men. There is little expectation of winning them over but Clintons team does want to limit her losses. She could fare worse with white men than Obama and still win, said another senior Clinton adviser.A big question is just how large a share of the white vote Trump can garner. Romney carried 59 percent four years ago — the highest since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His performance with white men was even more commanding; Romney won 62 percent of that group. He still lost.Clinton and her allies are hoping to cut into Trump’s numbers among white voters by appealing to those with college degrees, women in particular. The first television ad from her super PAC was a compilation of Trump’s controversial comments about women; the second featured a couple (from Ohio) taking offense at Trump mocking people with disabilities. Both appeared calibrated to woo suburban women.Trump’s demographic challenge is that he needs to make significant gains among working-class whites, without hemorrhaging much support among college-educated white voters and minorities whose numbers are growing in many key battlegrounds, such as Florida, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada.Virginia, for instance, had gone Republican in 10 straight elections, until 2008, when the diverse suburbs of Washington D.C. and the bedroom communities of Loudoun County provided a Democratic counterweight to the conservative southwestern part of the state.The fastest-growing segments of [the country’s] population are non-whites and Trump has literally alienated all of them, Stewart said.That’s certainly true in Florida, which is expected to be the largest battleground state and the one Clinton’s campaign will devote the most resources. The Cuban population in South Florida has historically voted Republican but has been moving to the left and Democrats say there are early indications the Cuban vote is falling apart for Trump. Trump’s goal: Offset those losses by increasing turnout among white, non-college educated voters.Clinton already has a 12-person senior staff on the ground in Florida, with office openings beyond the Tampa headquarters planned in the coming weeks. Staff there, one senior campaign official said, could balloon past the 600 people Obama deployed in a push for a knockout punch.If the Republicans don’t win Florida, a senior Clinton campaign official said, they probably have no path to win.

Scene outside Philadelphias City Hall as gatherers hold a candle light vigil for those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.   M. Scott MahaskeyThe House on Thursday blocked an amendment that opponents said would have taken away critical intelligence tools just four days after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The 198-222 vote is a blow for privacy advocates who have spent years building support for the amendment, which would have barred the government from forcing companies to weaken their encryption for law enforcement. The provision passed the House twice in 2014 and 2015 by wide margins, before being stripped each time during conferences with the Senate.But Sunday’s deadly assault in Orlando, in which suspected Islamic State supporter Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, caused a drastic erosion in support for the language. Opponents cited the attack as the main reason Congress couldn’t approve the amendment.This amendment prohibits the government from searching data already in its possession collected lawfully … to determine whether Omar Mateen was in contact [with terrorists overseas], said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) during the extended debate over the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations bill.Investigators have said they’re trying to determine whether Mateen communicated with any terrorist groups at home or abroad — a task that would be made more difficult if he used encryption to shield data on his phone or computer.Privacy advocates accused Goodlatte and other detractors of using fear tactics to reduce support for what has been a widely supported House amendment for two years running.It’s unfortunate my colleagues would take advantage of that situation, said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who co-sponsored the amendment with Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). The language does not take any tools away from those that want to investigate what happened in Orlando, Massie insisted.Advocates argue that the provision merely prevents the NSA or the CIA from requiring anyone to alter their products to allow digital snooping. They say this would preserve the encryption that protects the nation’s power grid, air traffic control system and all smartphones.Our government should strengthen the technology, Lofgren said, not take advantage of it.The Massie-Lofgren amendment will make America safer, she added.But national security-focused lawmakers worry that fully encrypted devices, such as the latest iPhones, and a growing array of encrypted apps are preventing authorities from reading digital communications even when they have a lawfully issued warrant. The dispute came to the fore following December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., when the FBI took Apple to court in an attempt to force the tech giant to help the Bureau crack into an iPhone used by shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The Justice Department dropped the San Bernardino case after the FBI said an unidentified third party helped it unlock Farook’s phone, leaving the larger legal question unresolved. The Manhattan district attorney’s office alone has said it has more than 270 iPhones that it’s been unable to crack. Sunday’s deadly attack proves once again that the terror threat has not dissipated, Goodlatte said. Now is not the time to block a critical investigative tool.Thursday’s vote represents a shift in congressional priorities since former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the extent of the government’s clandestine surveillance apparatus.In the wake of those disclosures, liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans came together to press for surveillance reform. Eventually, the bipartisan coalition pushed through the USA Freedom Act, the first major rollback of the NSA’s spying authorities in a generation. The House also got the Massie-Lofgren amendment approved 293-123 in 2014 and 255-174 the next year as part of two annual spending bills.But following major terror attacks both at home — in San Bernardino and Orlando — and abroad — in Paris and Brussels — hawkish lawmakers have moved to retain or expand government surveillance authorities.Numerous hawkish lawmakers have introduced bills to either delay surveillance reforms or strengthen the government’s ability to collect data. A widely supported email privacy bill — which would require law enforcement to seek a warrant before accessing stored email — is even being held up in the Senate over an amendment that would let the FBI use national security letters to obtain email and Internet metadata.                 The U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians.  John Shinkle/POLITICOThe House of Representatives is telling the military to lower the volume. Lawmakers who have been advocating for reducing the size and cost of military bands — now a half-billion-dollar a year enterprise — won a key victory Thursday with passage of a provision that would bar funding for musical units to play at dinners, dances or social events.The provision, the handiwork of Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, would ensure funds are not spent on entertaining generals, dignitaries and elected officials, all the different type of things that have nothing to do with appropriate military ceremonies but reserved for ceremonial tasks such as funerals.Her bipartisan amendment to the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations act was approved by voice vote.From their humble origins in the American Revolution’s fife-and-drum corps, the U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians — with some members outfitted with $11,000 flutes and $12,000 tubas. For every dollar that is spent on our bands ... to entertain at social functions, thats a dollar were not spending on national security and our troops and our families, McSally said.The band budget has drawn criticism from several lawmakers, including House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who said military bands may not be appropriate at every event.The vote marks the first successful attempt to try to scale back the overall budget for military bands. The amendment was cosponsored by New Mexico Republican Steve Pearce and Minnesota Democrat Betty McCollum, who tried herself several years ago to cap the spending on bands.McCollum in 2011 and 2012 proposed a $200 million annual spending limit on military bands, but the effort got heavy pushback inside the ranks and on Capitol Hill, who argued military musicians are a critical link between the men and women in uniform and those they protect. McSally, an Arizona Republican has made it no secret she hopes to curtail use of the musicians for entertainment purposes, and has spoken out often about how such funds could be better spent to directly support ongoing military operations.She told POLITICO that because military bands are funded through operation and maintenance accounts in each service, with this amendment, We wanted to make sure we werent looking like we were wanting to cut funding to the military personnel account.McSallys had sent a letter, urging her colleagues to back the measure, which she said will ensure military bands perform their proper duties and limit their performances to official ceremonies, honoring the fallen, and playing taps.The amendment comes on top of legislation in the Houses version of the defense authorization act passed last month that would require the Pentagon to determine whether it could ease cuts in combat units by reducing the number of musicians.The language requires the Government Accountability Office to review the cost and size of military bands. It also directs Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take an inventory of the bands and study the feasibility of combining some.It remains unclear whether the Houses decision will prevail when a final appropriations bill is hashed out with the Senate. There is likely to be significant pushback.                  The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office. Its difficult to imagine the old John McCain being this reckless with something so serious, said Kirkpatrick, who is running to unseat McCain from the Senate this November.

John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington. In a private meeting of Democrats on Wednesday, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) begged his colleagues to push a measure that might have actually prevented Sunday morning’s carnage in Orlando: an assault weapons ban.Cicilline was answering the call of President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, to keep weapons of war off the streets. But Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi nixed it. Better, she said, to focus on barring terror suspects from buying guns. That measure’s a no-brainer for Democrats, she reasoned, and easier to explain to the public. It’s not that we’re not strong enough to make the fight. It’s just that we want to win the fight, Pelosi said to her Democratic colleagues, according to sources in the room. What we are trying to do — and forget the politics — what we are trying to do is save lives. What we are trying to do is to say that the Republicans will not even go to this place which overwhelmingly the American people support.The top gun control advocates in the country share Pelosi’s strategy, as do Senate Democrats. They want to emphasize measures that have broad support — like expanding background checks — rather than trying to take America’s most popular rifle and its copy-cat semi-automatics (like the Sig Sauer MCX used in Orlando) off the shelves. Pelosi aides note, however, that she was a supporter of the 1994 assault weapons ban and has repeatedly called for its reinstatement.We work hard to try to stay out of the polarizing divisiveness that comes with this debate, said Mark Barden, who founded Sandy Hook Promise after his 7-year-old son Daniel was killed three years ago by a mentally ill young man with a Bushmaster AR-15. He doesnt believe those types of firearms have any practical application for untrained civilians, Barden said. However, we’ve identified the lack of engagement as really the No. 1 issue that is keeping this movement from moving forward. By steering around that, we feel like we can bring more people and more voices.Barden, reached on Thursday just after returning to Connecticut following a fundraiser in Washington, added, I want to get something done.Banning the AR-15 and other assault weapons just plays into the National Rifle Association’s warnings about the feds coming to take your guns, gun control advocates reason — and besides, most of the gun deaths that have become miserably routine are committed with handguns. The ban isn’t part of the Everytown for Gun Safety’s platform, said spokeswoman Lizzie Ulmer, though the Michael Bloomberg-backed group is sympathetic to the urge to bar weapons that put the mass in mass shootings. Ulmer said that background checks are the key to keeping dangerous people from using guns to hurt themselves and others.When you take a step back and look at preventing gun violence, it’s really about stopping guns from getting into the hands of these people, Ulmer said. That approach is shared by Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, both of whom stress their personal gun ownership and support for Second Amendment rights. There’s already evidence, meanwhile, that the no fly, no buy campaign is driving a wedge between the NRA and Republicans: Donald Trump, despite receiving a relatively early endorsement from the top gun rights group, drew the line with them on Twitter on Wednesday when he declared that he would meet with its leaders about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns. That prompted a rebuke from Heritage Action on Thursday, which viewed Trump as getting on board with Clinton and congressional Democrats.It took nearly 15 hours of filibustering on the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday for Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to win the promise of votes on background check and terror watch list measures — important statement votes that are widely expected to fail.Nonetheless, many Democrats say they should be pushing for more amid unprecedented unity over gun control. Gay rights groups, teachers unions, immigration advocates and even abortion rights groups have signed on to the cause of gun violence prevention after mass shootings at a gay night club’s Latin night in Orlando, a black church in Charleston, an abortion clinic in Colorado Springs and schools around the country.Cicilline is pushing for a discharge petition in the House, which would require every member to go on the record on an assault weapons ban. He’s getting back-up from the progressive movement: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has collected over 26,000 signatures in support of the discharge petition over the last 24 hours. MoveOn.org has collected more than half a million signatures calling for a ban generally.At major national moments, the lowest common denominator solutions aren’t enough, said PCCC’s Sarah Badawi in an interview Thursday.Obama on Thursday found himself once again expressing grief over another mass shooting, and made sure to talk up the dire risk of assault weapons.Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families, Obama said in Orlando after meeting with survivors and victims’ families. The shooter used a Sig Sauer MCX to kill 49 people and injure 53 others — a high-powered gun that would likely be taken off shelves under an assault weapons ban. Clinton, who highlighted guns as a key area where she was to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, has consistently advocated for an assault weapons ban on the trail. Perhaps more remarkable is her husband’s fresh call for tighter security on the AR-15 after Orlando. Its pretty clear that if youre firing … a lot of ammunition in a short amount of time with a weapon thats designed only to kill, more people will die than if youre stuck with a pistol, Bill Clinton said Tuesday. If the guy had just had a pistol in that nightclub, I dont think anybody believes he could possibly have killed 49 people.That’s in contrast to the weeks after Sandy Hook, when he said the 1994 assault weapons ban had devastated Democrats in that year’s midterms and warned his party not to overplay its hand.While Obama has talked about an assault weapons ban multiple times since the Orlando massacre last weekend, he has yet to mount a big political push for it. Polling also makes clear the higher pay-off for less aggressive measures. While support for a ban has spiked in the wake of Orlando (57 percent of respondents in a CBS poll released on Wednesday back a ban, up from 44 percent in December), almost 9-in-10 Americans support universal background checks, according to that poll, including 82 percent of gun owners. Those figures have held relatively steady since Newtown.That overwhelming support for background checks — along with studies on their effectiveness in reducing gun crime — were why researchers at the liberal Center for American Progress deemed that professional gun control advocates’ shift in focus to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns is appropriate in 2014.However, some Democrats point to strategic benefits of having a vote on assault weapons, even if it’s a lost cause — it’s easier to vote for reasonable gun restrictions if you’re drawing a line on the extreme gun grab. Sixteen Democratic senators voted against the assault weapons ban on April 17, 2013, including the current head of their campaign arm, Montana’s Jon Tester. Yet all but four of them voted in favor of proceeding with expanded background check legislation that same day. Sen. Joe Donnelly used the specter of the ban to explain his vote in favor of the background checks. History shows that Congress begins re-examining proposals that would infringe on citizens 2nd Amendment rights, like the assault weapons ban, which I oppose, only when someone who shouldnt have had guns in the first place uses them to commit mass murder, he said at the time.  When Democrats go on offense and shift the conversation about these bigger ideas, that puts more oxygen in the room to have the conversation about these more important elements, PCCC’s Badawi said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for an assault weapons ban who introduced the 2013 version, said she still feels as strongly.In light of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, I believe we have an obligation to revisit this issue, Feinstein said in a statement Tuesday, adding that she was considering re-introducing the bill and conferring with colleagues. A spokeswoman said Thursday that Feinstein had yet to make a decision.                  President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, in honor of people killed in the shooting at a gay nightclub.  GettyPresident Barack Obama on Thursday demanded that lawmakers put politics aside and move forward on the longstanding impasse over gun legislation in the wake of the latest tragedy.  Obama found himself consoling families of the victims of an Orlando, Florida, massacre that Congress had done little to prevent through legislation, even after mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado.  Today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents and they asked why does this keep happening, Obama said Thursday, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden. And they pleaded that we do more to stop the carnage. They don’t care about the politics. Neither do I. Neither does Joe. And neither should any parent out here.The president spoke for nearly 18 minutes, sharing anecdotes he heard from families and thanking first responders, medical personnel and law enforcement for their response efforts. But he also emphasized the reality of what prompted his visit.   Four days ago this community was shaken by an evil and hateful act, he said.  Indeed, Omar Mateen, a New York-born Florida resident who had pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history Sunday when he rampaged through an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others before he was shot dead by police.As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description, Obama said of the families he and Biden met with. Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives.Obama noted that the families impacted by the Orlando massacre could be any American families.In fact, they are our family. They’re part of the American family, he said. Today, the vice president and I told them on behalf of the American people that our hearts are broken, too, and that we stand with you and that we are here for you and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply.The latest terror attack reignited the debate over gun restrictions. Though Mateen had been investigated by the FBI multiple times, he was able to purchase firearms, including the long gun he used to slaughter 49 people and injure dozens more. This debate needs to change. It’s outgrown the old political stalemates, Obama said of the deadlock over guns. The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why this makes sense.While pledging that the U.S. will ultimately destroy the Islamic State and other terrorist networks with its relentlessness — by disrupting their networks, financing, fighters and propaganda — Obama acknowledged that the past two terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were homegrown and that more needs to be done to stop such events from recurring.If you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we’re gonna have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening, he said before pointing specifically to what transpired in Orlando. Now those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead. Another 53 are injured. Some are still fighting for their lives. Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.Senate Democrats launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster Wednesday to force votes on gun control legislation and expect to vote on gun measures Tuesday. But there’s little hope those votes will result in new laws that restrict assault weapons or other, more modest measures. Obama said he was pleased that the Senate would hold votes but challenged them to do the right thing. I truly hope that senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope that senators who voted ‘no’ on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart, and then I hope the House does the right thing and helps end the plague of violence that these weapons of war inflict on so many young lives, he said.He reiterated that the U.S. can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person who wants to harm others but maintained that by taking action on gun restrictions, Congress can limit the damage being done.Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora or Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally, he continued. I’ve said this before: We will not be able to stop every tragedy. We can’t wipe away hatred and evil from every heart in this world. But we can stop some tragedies. We can save some lives. We can reduce the impact of a terrorist attack if we’re smart. And if we don’t act, he warned, we will keep seeing more massacres like this because we’ll be choosing to allow them to happen. We will have said we don’t care enough to do something about it.Obama contended that Sunday’s attack wasn’t a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rather, he said, they were having fun at a place they considered to be a safe haven.Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way imaginable, Obama said. This was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community. Americans were targeted because we’re a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love. Now if we’re honest with ourselves, if in fact we wanna show the best of our humanity, then we’re all gonna have to work together at every level of government across political lines to do more to stop killers who wanna terrorize us, he added. Principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters during a gaggle en route to Orlando that Obama has had to embark on these trips with too much regularity, but emphasized that the president wanted to meet privately with the families of victims, survivors and law enforcement. He wants to make sure that those families who are going through this unimaginable pain know that the president of the United States is there with them, Schultz said. For understandable and obvious reasons, those conversations will not be in front of the cameras. This healing process is not going to happen overnight. Its not going to be a quick one. Thats all the more reason why the president wanted to be there in person. Obama exited Air Force One on Thursday afternoon alongside Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Corrine Brown, all of whom were greeted by Biden, Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Bill Nelson, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs. The White House said Obama and Biden met with law enforcement officials to thank them for their actions in responding to the attack ahead of a separate meeting with families and survivors, which pool reports indicate lasted about two hours. They also met with owners and staff of the nightclub where the carnage occurred. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J.

As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains.

As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes.

A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns.

In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns.

I don’t think we should have to beg, infer and guess. In 2016’s race to the bottom, Donald Trump is going to find out if you can become president when two-thirds of Americans don’t like you — and a majority can’t stand you.Recent polls have showed Trump’s unfavorable rating spiking again, after a brief improvement last month. That’s also coincided with a slide in national horse-race polls, which now unanimously show Hillary Clinton leading the presumptive Republican nominee. Clinton is also more unpopular than past nominees, but her negatives are neither as wide nor as deep as the broadly detested Trump.Trump is setting modern records for political toxicity — at least for a major-party candidate this far out from an election. Seventy percent of Americans surveyed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, up 10 points over the past month. The poll showed Trump’s favorable rating cratering at 29 percent, down from 37 percent last month.The numbers were similar in a Bloomberg Politics poll: Trump’s favorable rating is just 31 percent, with 66 percent viewing him unfavorably. That’s only marginally better than in March, when 29 percent viewed Trump favorably, and 68 percent had an unfavorable opinion.Gallup’s latest figures show Trump at 31 percent favorable/63 percent unfavorable – significantly worse than Clinton’s 41 percent favorable/54 percent unfavorable.Those high unfavorables extend to the battleground states: A Marquette Law School poll out Wednesday found 64 percent of Wisconsin voters view Trump unfavorably — compared to only 26 percent who have a favorable opinion of him.But it’s not just the overall unfavorable numbers — it’s the intensity of the antipathy toward Trump, and the lack of enthusiasm for him. In the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 56 percent of respondents had a strongly unfavorable opinion of Trump, compared to just 15 percent who had a strongly favorable opinion. In the Bloomberg poll, 51 percent had a very unfavorable opinion of Trump, with only 11 percent having a very favorable opinion.Voters with a strongly unfavorable opinion are obviously more difficult to move than people who are undecided or just unfavorable, said Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown. The stronger the dislike, the more difficult it is to change that person’s view.Clinton’s image ratings are also upside-down — but compared with Trump, she’s more than likable enough. The ABC News/Washington Post poll pegs her favorable rating at 43 percent (25 percent strongly favorable), with 55 percent viewing her unfavorably (39 percent strongly unfavorable). That’s a new low-water mark for Clinton, though it’s still only a slight decline since the campaign began. (The Bloomberg poll was similar for Clinton: 43 percent favorable, 54 percent unfavorable.)Clinton is seeking to move those numbers in her direction. On Thursday, the presumptive Democratic nominee launched a series of swing-state television ads, some aimed at boost her image and others hitting Trump.Trump’s unpopularity is without historical peer in the modern era of presidential campaigns. Mitt Romney averaged a 46-percent unfavorable rating in mid-June 2012, according to the HuffPost Pollster database. John McCain’s unfavorable rating four years prior was only 40 percent, and more voters had a positive opinion of the Arizona senator than a negative one. In June 2004, then-Sen. John Kerry had a 58-percent favorable rating, according to Gallup, with only 35 percent viewing him unfavorably. Also from Gallup: Al Gore, in late June 2000, had a 52-percent favorable rating, and Bob Dole had a 55-percent favorable rating in June 1996.Then-President George H.W. Bush is the last candidate to have a majority-unfavorable rating in June of an election year (51 percent unfavorable in June 1992), according to Gallup. But Bill Clinton’s unfavorable rating that year (47 percent) was also high. In May 1988, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, Michael Dukakis had an otherworldly 67-percent favorable rating, with just 10 percent viewing him unfavorably.The Dukakis figures offer a historical warning: The former Massachusetts governor had a significant lead over Bush entering the summer of 1988, but Bush overtook and soundly defeated Dukakis later that year. By early October, Dukakis’ stellar image rating had been slashed in half: More voters in a CBS News/New York Times poll by that time viewed Dukakis unfavorably than favorably.But Gallup editor in chief Frank Newport sees some parallels in the 1992 campaign. Unfavorable opinions of Bush reached as high as 57 percent in the fall, when he was in the heat of combat, Newport said.And Ross Perot, the independent Texas billionaire who won nearly 19 percent of the vote, saw his negatives enter Trump territory, Newport said.There were times when Perot had a 66-percent unfavorable rating, said Newport, which is comparable to where we have Trump right now.Bill Clinton, too, had high negatives in that race until the Democratic convention in New York, which began his turnaround. Newport said it was too soon to speculate whether Trump, a master showman, could use the Cleveland GOP convention next month to engineer a similar turnaround. But he suggested voters’ perceptions of Trump could be too baked-in for the Republican nominee to pull it off.Clinton had a remarkably positive convention that summer and suddenly became wildly popular, Newport said. Perhaps you could argue Clinton was a little newer on the scene in ’92 than Trump is now.Brown, the Quinnipiac pollster, attributed a line to former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.Will the United States elect a president whom more than half the people view unfavorably? Brown said. Today, the answer to that question looks like it might be yes. BURLINGTON, Vt. — Leverage: it’s the one thing Bernie Sanders’ advisors and aides consistently point to when asked why, exactly, he’s formally staying in the Democratic primary race that he’s lost to Hillary Clinton.But its the one thing he’s been bleeding every day ever since he dropped California’s primary by a much wider-than-expected margin last week. Sanders’ summer was supposed to be all about building leverage for the Democratic convention, providing him with a better hand to play as he presses Clinton to accept his policy positions and party reform suggestions. Now, the people closest to him aren’t sure how exactly to get it back.His first and most prominent endorsers have jumped off the bandwagon, congratulating and in some cases endorsing Clinton — from Sen. Jeff Merkley to Rep. Raul Grijalva, and from the Communications Workers of America to MoveOn.org.Each of the big-name Democrats and groups who steadfastly remained neutral in the primary have flocked to Clinton over the past week, from President Barack Obama to Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the AFL-CIO. Even Sanders highest-profile congressional endorsee, Nevada’s Lucy Flores, lost her primary bid on Tuesday despite his cash injection into her campaign.Yet on Thursday night, speaking to over 200,000 viewers who tuned into his live-streamed video address, Sanders vowed to press on — pledging to fight to defeat Donald Trump but refusing to formally back Clinton and insisting his army of supporters isn’t going anywhere.We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become, he said, nearly acknowledging defeat but making a point not to concede while reading from a prompter in a cramped television studio deep in his hometown. And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.Speaking for 23 minutes, the Vermont senator rattled off a long list of policy stances and political changes he wants to push for the future of the party, each of which would need Clinton’s imprimatur to become reality -- from new leadership for the Democratic National Committee to a $15 federal minimum wage.If Democrats were expecting a less combative Sanders to formally exit the race on Thursday, it was a misunderstanding of his posture. His staffers believe that continuing to pull Clinton and the party to the left is only achievable as long as Sanders is still formally a candidate with a considerable number of delegates behind him at the July convention.And while his team has started signaling that it’s reached a new phase, it’s still far from sounding a truly conciliatory tone.We would like to get to a place where we could very actively support the nominee, campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Bloomberg Television on Thursday — a hope-filled line for Clinton’s team that nonetheless implied there was still considerable work to be done before true unity is achieved.To Sanders’ most steadfast remaining supporters, anything short of a continued campaign to tug Clinton on specific points — from embracing a nationwide ban on fracking to axing the superdelegate system — would be an abandonment of his political revolution.Bernie Sanders has brought a lot of new people into the Democratic fold, and I think it would be wise for Secretary Clinton to keep them close to the Democratic Party and close to her, said Utah Democratic Party chairman Peter Corroon, one of the superdelegates who remains with Sanders. His leverage comes from his supporters, and so while the prospects [of a victory] at the convention may be lower, I think there’s a whole group of people that Secretary Clinton needs to pay attention to. And if Senator Sanders is asking for something that will help keep them in the fold, then she should listen.We look forward to the Democratic Party embracing key aspects of his platform, added Anna Galland, the executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action — a group that backed Sanders before congratulating Clinton on her victory on Wednesday. We look forward to his historic campaign influencing the convention and how the Democratic Party acts moving forward.Sanders’ evening comments came while his team continues talks with Clinton’s aides about policies they’re looking to see on the party platform or in the front-runner’s agenda moving forward, and just two days after Clinton and Sanders sat down with their senior aides in Washington to talk in person for the first time in months.While they spoke for well over an hour and a half — longer than campaign officials initially expected — and issued nearly identical statements after the meeting, their Tuesday evening talk subtly indicated significant distance.Clinton, for example, noted that the two had discussed unifying the party — a phrase that was glaringly omitted from Sanders’ version. And the section of his statement where his team ran through the issues discussed by the candidates included a reference to making healthcare universal and accessible, a tense point of disagreement between the two that wasn’t included in the presumptive nominees statement.What’s unclear now is just how far Sanders can push Clinton, whose campaign is coming off one of its strongest stretches yet, and who has fully pivoted to taking on Trump with a series of speeches and an ad barrage that the real estate developer shows no signs of being able to match.Far from just leading Trump in national polls, Clinton’s allies now note that battleground state surveys also suggest she has little reason to fear that tepid support from Sanders backers could doom her.She has, nonetheless, started to show a willingness to tack left toward Sanders, scheduling an economic policy speech set for Ohio next week that could include nods to his agenda. On Thursday, the Clinton campaign also installed a new chief of staff at the DNC who comes from the Service Employees International Union — a labor pick that could be welcome to Sanders’ rank-and-file supporters.Still, the preliminary nature of those steps has not slowed the stream of ardent Sanders backers rallying to Clinton’s side in recent days. The loss of Merkley — his lone Senate endorser — and Grijalva — his first House supporter — were especially stinging, as was the immediate Clinton endorsement from liberal hero Warren.Such officials are seeing the handwriting on the wall as others are, acknowledged Corroon, noting that he hasn’t heard from Clinton’s team since she claimed the nomination. I think they probably should have waited ’til all the caucuses and primaries were over before saying anything.But now that they’re over, he said, things aren’t looking as positive as some had hoped.                 A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday. O’Brien is a late-night comic. He is also an observer of life in these United States. It is sometimes hard to observe that life and still remain a comic, and I admire him for trying.I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think, he said, his voice growing angrier as he spoke. However, I am the father of two, and I like to believe I have a shred of common sense, and I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semi-automatic assault rifle. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life.I do not know what the answer is, but I wanted to take just a moment here tonight to agree with the rapidly growing sentiment in America that it’s time to grow up and figure this out.Time to grow up. A fine idea. And I really wish the sentiment behind it was rapidly growing. Because not everybody in America will get a chance to grow up. Some of those children we send each morning to the safety of their schools will never make it back home alive. (According to the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, Since 2013, there have been at least 188 school shootings in America, an average of nearly one a week.)On Capitol Hill on Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for a ritual moment of silence in the House chamber to commemorate those killed in Orlando.Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes stood up and walked off the floor instead. Previously, he had tweeted:I will not attend one more ‘Moment of Silence’ on the Floor. Our silence does not honor the victims, it mocks them.The Moments of Silence in the House have become an abomination. God will ask you, ‘How did you keep my children safe’? Silence.If God is an angry God, prepare to know a hell well beyond that lived day to day by the families of the butchered. I will not be silent.’And I, for one, hope he keeps talking, tweeting, speaking out and walking out.Roger Simon is POLITICOs chief political columnist.                 A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday.

Math beats mouth.Donald Trump plans to defeat Hillary Clinton through blustery force of will and word — but the architect of Ted Cruz’s efficient, numbers-focused campaign thinks Trump is making a huge mistake by burning the modern electoral playbook. Jeff Roe, a burly and self-deprecating 43-year-old former baseball umpire and onetime howitzer-crew hand, estimates that the presumptive Republican nominee is costing himself from 2.5 to 5.5 percentage points nationally by refusing to invest more time, energy and cash in data, analytics and a first-rate ground operation.By any calculation those are precious points that Trump, who faces an uphill climb against Hillary Clinton on the electoral map — and has trailed the Democratic nominee in most polls — can’t afford to lose. He dumped our ass, right? He won, we lost, so lets keep everything in perspective, Roe told me during a 90-minute interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast that quickly turned into an intense tutorial in Republican campaign strategy and management — and a warning to the man who beat his boss.(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Theres a trove of information thats done in and around politics that Trump needs to tap, said Roe, who credits Cruz’s big win in the Iowa caucuses to the campaign’s identification and targeting of precisely 9,181 voters who were undecided but had Cruz and Trump as their final choices.It’s worth, on its worst day, 2½ points, and in its best day, 5½ points, he added. So let’s just split the difference and say that Clinton’s running a great [operation]. ... He’s not right now, so that would give her ... 3½ points.In May, Trump, who has the smallest and least experienced staff of any recent presidential campaign, told The Associated Press he thought President Barack Obama’s vaunted get-out-the-vote machine was a chimera, and that Obama really won on account of his own personal popularity, Trump-style.I’ve always felt it was overrated, Trump said, using language that conjured up images of green-eyeshade clerks feeding punch cards into 1970s computers. Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.In the absence of his own operation — or even an understanding of how the increasingly sophisticated system of identifying voters through their purchases, political activities and other demographic information works — Trump is relying on the Republican National Committee’s relatively modest voter outreach department.Big, big mistake, Roe told me. I don’t know everything that he has, but I do know a couple of things, he said. It’s going to be very hard for him to just use the RNC. The RNC has got a very candidate-generic model. ... [In Iowa,] we knew voters’ names and what they cared about and how they received their information.Roe is still close to Cruz and says his boss, like Obama, gobbles political intelligence and data like a professional, with insights candidates of previous eras (and Trump is nothing if not stubbornly retro) lacked.Over the next few weeks Cruz’s team, still largely intact, will conduct an autopsy of the campaign from a data and messaging standpoint and dial-test Cruz’s greatest hits and lowest moments with voter focus groups. The goal is to figure out a path forward, which quite possibly involves a second shot at the big prize in 2020, and Roe thinks Trump, win or lose in 2016, won’t be on the ballot four years from now.If Trump wins, I can’t imagine that he’d be in a reelect, right? he asked. He’s already reached the mountain. You don’t climb Kilimanjaro twice if you’re him. Cruz, conspicuously, remains the biggest GOP name not to endorse Trump. The reason, Roe said, is partly Trump’s decision to go very personal on the senator’s family, but also a professional calculation (with overtones of sweet revenge): Despite Trump’s claim that he’ll bring new independents into the process, 2016 promises to be the same-old base election and he’ll need the hard-core conservatives Lyin’ Ted was so good at galvanizing.Is it possible Cruz won’t endorse?Gosh. Yeah. Yeah, for sure, thats possible, said Roe, adding that he’s had only sporadic contact with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, talking or texting a half-dozen times since Cruz suspended his campaign a month back. I mean, if you learn anything from The Art of the Deal, [it] is you have leverage, you have something that somebody wants. Don’t ever act like you want to make a deal until you make a deal, OK? Then he smiled and eased back in his chair. Trump told Ted, ‘I dont need his votes,’ Roe said, with relish. OK? So that’s one way to look at it. If, at some point in the campaign, he believes he needs the votes and he believes that [they’re] key to him winning, then the conservatives will have leverage, and I think thats really damn important leverage. ... [We’ll be] able to hold him accountable.He refused to say whether Trump has asked Cruz to climb on board yet.Roe says Cruz’s surprising success was the candidate’s doing and not that of his 150-person Houston-based staff. But Republicans on opposing campaigns credit Roe’s stewardship, including an intense focus on metrics found more often in Democratic campaigns, for the Texas senator’s tempered triumph. (Jeff’s pretty good. Cruz won what — nine states? — and everybody thinks he’s the Zodiac [killer], said one former opponent, referencing an online joke that dogged Cruz during the campaign.)It’s not surprising that Roe, who shares his boss’s conservative social views as well as his delight in torturing more moderate Hill Republicans, doesn’t think much of Clinton’s policy positions or her personal political skills. But he’s a fan of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 operations and thinks Trump would be wise to notice the plodding but effective ground campaign she waged against Bernie Sanders.From an Xs-and-Os [perspective]… through a nonpartisan lens, they clearly have that part of their game buttoned up, he said of Clinton’s Brooklyn-based operation, overseen by campaign manager Robbie Mook and an analytics and organizing team that includes many former Obama operatives.Theyre not crushing fundraising, but theyre raising good money. Theyre not crushing ground, but theyre doing it really smart and effective. ... [Clinton voters] have little energy, but they’re overperforming their election night numbers routinely. That tells me that they know what they’re doing on the ground.Roe, who came up in the sharp-elbowed world of Missouri politics and has been known for his own stiletto tactics, offered a few lacerating comments about both major party candidates and their stratospheric disapproval ratings. The irony, he said with a chuckle, is that these people found the only person in the other party they could beat.Even though he dismisses the complaint that Cruz, who buddied up to Trump in early debates, waited too long to pounce, he acknowledges that the crowded field denied the Texas senator the chance to go one-on-one with the reality star.And he thinks that’s the key to beating him.Trump won, in part, because the pack was divided and because Cruz failed to move Marco Rubio and John Kasich aside quickly enough. Yeah, we could take him [mano a mano], yeah, no doubt, Roe told me.In a general election, Trump no longer enjoys the safety of the GOP herd. And with Sanders sliding offstage, Clinton has begun focusing her attacks exclusively on the real-estate mogul, something that didn’t happen until relatively late in the Republican primaries. Taking on Trump is smart, Roe said of her decision to hit the GOP nominee before decisively defeating Sanders in California earlier this month. It will be the thing that saves her.When Cruz finally got tough, Trump began dodging debates — and Roe predicted he’ll soon find an excuse to limit his onstage interactions with Clinton despite the widespread view that Trump’s attacks will make Clinton look weak and beatable.I dont know that theyll have one. ... I bet if they do, they only have one, he said of potential debates. Everybody’s going to bake it into the cake that she’s going to win, and he’s going to look like a fool and say the same things over and over. She will have the apparatus to have the time to prepare. Trump’s his own guy. He’ll be tired.I’m sure he’s going to do one, and he’ll call it a draw. He’ll win the Drudge poll afterwards, Roe added.

People wait for the start of a memorial service on June 19, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.   GettySupport for stronger gun control measures increased by 9 percentage points in recent days, after 49 people were killed inside an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, according to the results of a new CNN/ORC poll released Monday.The poll found 55 percent of Americans are in favor of stricter gun laws, with 42 percent opposed, which matches the highest level of support since the poll was taken in January 2013, just one month after Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. When the question was last asked in October 2015, 46 percent said they were in favor with 52 percent opposed.Further, 58 percent of respondents said they disapprove of how President Barack Obama is handling gun policy, compared with 36 percent who approve. When asked about specific policy steps, 92 percent of respondents favored expanded background checks, 87 percent supported prohibiting convicted felons or people with mental health problems from buying guns and 85 percent were in support of banning people on the terror watch list or on the no-fly list from buying guns. Only 9 percent of those surveyed supported preventing all Americans from owning guns. When it comes to banning the manufacture and sale of semi-automatic assault rifles, 54 percent said they were in favor, while 44 percent were opposed, virtually unchanged from the previous survey.The poll results come just before the Senate is set to vote on four gun control bills, all of which are expected to fail along party lines.The poll surveyed 1,001 adults between June 16 and June 19 via landlines and cellphones. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.                 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — while supportive of the assault weapons ban — has focused more on the No fly, no buy gun provision.  GettyA group of liberal House Democrats are calling on Speaker Paul Ryan to hold a vote on an assault weapons ban before Congress adjourns for the summer recess, according to a letter being circulated among lawmakers.The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes 75 House Democrats, wants Ryan to postpone the seven-week House recess that begins July 15 unless there is a vote on the measure. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other senior Democrats — while supportive of the assault weapons ban — have focused more on the No fly, no buy gun provision, as well as expanded background checks for gun sales. Senate Democratic leaders have also adopted the same strategy as that chamber prepares for four gun-related votes on Monday.But progressive Democrats in both the House and Senate want to go even further. Noting that Orlando gunman Omar Mateen used an assault weapon — a Sig Sauer MCX rifle — to kill 49 people and wound 53 more in the June 11 massacre, these lawmakers say more needs to be done. They are seeking a vote on Rep. David Cicillines (D-R.I.) proposed ban on assault weapons. Cicilline introduced the bill in December, and it currently has 139 co-sponsors. With this in mind, we write today to strongly urge you to hold the House of Representatives in session until we take up the Assault Weapons Ban of 2015, the Democratic letter states, according to a copy obtained by POLITICO.  It is well past time for Congress to take action to protect the American people. Our constituents strongly support substantive reforms to reduce gun violence, and they are demanding we take steps to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring these weapons of war.The letter adds: We must use every tool available to address the epidemic of gun violence in the United States, and we must start by acting to take assault weapons off of our streets. We have the responsibility to protect the American people from dangerous individuals with military-style assault weapons. For these reasons, we urge you to hold the House of Representatives in session until we consider the Assault Weapons Ban of 2015.Ryans office had no comment on the Progressive Caucus letter, which has not formally been sent to the speaker yet.                 Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said.  AP PhotoRepublicans on Monday assailed the Justice Departments decision to redact the Orlando shooters declaration of allegiance to the Islamic State in transcripts of 911 calls from the June 12 shooting as another example of not focusing on the evil here, as Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.After the unredacted version was released later in the day, Ryan said he was glad about the reversal but that this should have never been an issue in the first place. The attempt to selectively edit the record reflects a broader, more serious problem: this administration’s continued effort to downplay and distract from the threat of radical Islamist extremism, Ryan said in the later statement. This is unacceptable. To defeat terrorism we have to be clear-eyed about whom we’re fighting.This is evil, this is ISIS. Its radical Islam. At some point, we lost 49 lives here and we lost a journalist who was beheaded by ISIS, Scott told Fox News Bill Hemmer on Americas Newsroom, referring to the shooting last Sunday and the 2014 beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, who was from Florida. We need a president that’s going to say I care about destroying ISIS.Attorney General Loretta Lynch reasoned to CNN Sunday that the reason for the edits is to avoid re-victimizing those people that went through this horror, adding that it will contain the substance of his conversations. The FBI used similar language at a Monday news conference to explain its reasoning.I have no idea what she means, Scott said. But I can tell you what: I have gone to funerals, Ive sat down and cried with the parents. Ive gone and visited individuals in the hospitals. They are grieving. Now, they want answers. If it was my family I would want answers. We all would like answers. She should release everything that doesnt impact the investigation. I can understand if it impacted the investigation until this is finished, I get that. But she is not saying that. It doesnt make any sense to me. We have to get serious about destroying ISIS.The federal governments decision did not sit well with other Fox News guests on Monday morning, either.That would mean during the Second World War if I called up and said I am part of the Nazi movement, Ive joined here in the United States, and Im going kill 49 Americans and we left out Nazi movement, Rudy Giuliani said Monday on Fox & Friends.The redactions represent a degree of denial for the United States, Giuliani said, adding that it helps to cause the terrorists to be encouraged to commit more attacks.For Richard Grenell, who served in the George W. Bush administration as a spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , the decision to censor the words has policy implications and is not just a simple wording issue.The fact that Loretta Lynch is somehow redacting the enemy, the specific enemy that is being called out here is really a PR move, said Grenell. You only redact information when it reveals sources and methods, our intelligence-gathering techniques that we don’t want out there. That is the only reason. We have the same problem in the Hillary emails, where they’re redacting information for PR purposes.Later in the show, during Giulianis interview, co-host Steve Doocy commented, But, mayor, if you remove all references to radical Islam, you are removing the motive.Uh, yeah. Yeah, said Giuliani, who was a federal prosecutor before he became New York mayor.  I mean if I did that in court as a prosecutor my boss would fire me. The jury wants to know the motive for the crime. The killer has told us the motive for his crime. It would be like removing -- Im killing my friend because he cheated me out of money.The same principle applies for the Mafia, Giuliani remarked, alluding to his work indicting members of New Yorks Five Families. If you didnt see the connection between Italian-Americans and the Mafia, he said, you never could have brought them down.Asked about Donald Trumps recent comments in which he suggested that he would consider profiling individuals to prevent future acts of terrorism, Giuliani responded, We always profile.When I was police commissioner, involved in police work, assistant U.S. attorney, you call me up, you tell me a 6-foot-2 white man with blond hair and blue eyes was the killer, I profile white men with blue eyes and I go look for them, Giuliani said. You give me a larger number of people like that who are doing it, and I start to wonder: Are they part of a group? Could the Ku Klux Klan be in New York? So, then I profile the Ku Klux Klan. Of course you profile. Thats what policing is all about. Here’s where it’s wrong: it’s when you do it based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, just for that reason, just because you don’t like them. But [its good] if youre doing it based on hard facts that lead to protection of the public like a group of one type.                 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) earlier Monday issued a sarcastic statement mocking the deletions.  GettyThe FBI reversed itself and publicly issued a complete transcript of a 911 call from the Orlando nightclub shooter Monday afternoon after coming under withering criticism from House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans for deleting references to the Islamic State group as well as the groups leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.A version of the text of the 50-second call between an Orlando 911 dispatcher and shooter Omar Mateen disclosed Monday morning, included his claim of responsibility for the shooting, but was edited to remove Mateens mention of ISIL and of Al-Baghdadi.The FBI said the redactions were intended to limit any publicity benefit for ISIL, but House Speaker Paul Ryan sharply rejected that rationale and called on President Barack Obama to reverse the decision.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community, Ryan said. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.Hours later, the FBI did just that, saying that the deletions had caused an unnecessary distraction.The purpose of releasing the partial transcript of the shooters interaction with 911 operators was to provide transparency, while remaining sensitive to the interests of the surviving victims, their families, and the integrity of the ongoing investigation. We also did not want to provide the killer or terrorist organizations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda, the FBI and the Justice Department said in a joint statement emailed to reporters.Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime, the statement said.The FBI and Justice Department also noted that Mateens pledge of allegiance to ISIL had been previously reported, although those reports generally cited anonymous law enforcement sources.The reversal appeared to be an effort by the Justice Department and FBI to avoid fueling a longrunning debate about whether the administration has been unwilling to recognize the threat posed by radical Islam and is too politically correct in its public statements to avoid offending Muslims.Obama has said the administration fully understands the threat, but uses language intended to avoid alienating vast numbers of Muslims who harbor no hostility towards the U.S. Hes also said that attributing the attacks to radical Islam, would accomplish nothing.The more detailed transcript offers little insight into Mateens detailed motivations beyond his clear pledge of loyalty to ISIL and Al-Baghdadi. The shooter also uttered some common Arabic prayers.Asked his name, Mateen replied: My name is I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State.Again asked to identify himself, Mateen did not give his name, but said: I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi may God protect him [Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State.While the Obama administration has stressed that the attack appears to have been a hate crime targeted at the LGBT community and the popular gay nightclub, Mateen made no mention of any issues related to sexual orientation.Following Ryans comment, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) issued a sarcastic statement mocking the deletions and linking that decision to the administrations broader policy.The Obama Administration just redacted the [blank] out of the Orlando shooter’s 911 transcripts. I am greatly [blank] at the Administration’s denial of reality. How in the [blank] does censoring this [blank] make us [blank]?  McCaul said. This is in line with the Administration’s long string of [blank] of the threat Islamist terror poses to our homeland. The victims and their loved ones deserve justice, and the American people deserve all the facts. The terror threat to our nation cannot be redacted.An addendum to McCauls statement restored the deletions.In addition to removing the ISIL and Al-Baghdadi references, the initial FBI transcript referred to Mateen only by his initials. The newly-issued transcript gives his first and last names, which authorities publicly confirmed more than a week ago.The FBI and local police are still withholding recordings of all 911 calls and radio traffic, as well as transcripts of calls made by victims and people other than Mateen.Redactions have been made to avoid re-victimizing those who were in the Pulse nightclub, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Lee Bentley said. We wanted to release the transcripts at this time so the public would have a better idea of the timeline.Matthew Dixon and Nick Gass contributed to this report.                 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook slammed Donald Trump and his economic proposals.  GettyDonald Trump’s economic policies wouldn’t just move the U.S. backward; they would drive the country into an economic ice age, according to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook slammed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s economic proposals, adding that in addition to being unfit for the White House, the billionaire is also an economic threat.Mook argued that Trump’s tax plan would increase the national debt by more than $30 trillion over two decades and blasted him for suggesting that his administration would allow the U.S. to default on its debt, which would literally cause a global economic catastrophe far worse than anything we saw in 2008, he said.And, you know, we’ve seen what he’s done in his own business endeavors, where he has no problem defaulting on debt, Mook told SiriusXM’s The Agenda hosted by Ar Rabin-Havt, according to an early excerpt of the interview, which will air in full on Tuesday. He has no problem bankrupting his companies. So this is a real threat, and then look — his tax plan is gonna benefit people like him.A Moody’s Analytics analysis on Trump’s economic policies released Monday found that the real estate mogul’s plans — taken at face value — would significantly weaken the country, causing a lengthy recession with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate. The report also determined that Trump’s proposals would largely benefit very high-income households. Mook also said that Trump would abandon reforms in Dodd-Frank, legislation enacted to prevent another financial crisis in the wake of what transpired in 2008, start trade wars overseas and take America backward on immigration reform.When you bundle all this together, you know, he would send us into an economic ice age, Mook said.Mark Zandi, a chief economist at Moody’s Analytics and lead author of the report, is a former John McCain adviser and Clinton donor. A Federal Election Commission report shows he donated the maximum $2,700 to Clinton’s primary campaign last June.                 Apple CEO Tim Cook will hold a fundraiser with Speaker Paul Ryan, after Apple said they would not be participating in this years Republican National Convention.  GettyApple CEO Tim Cook will host a fundraiser with House Speaker Paul Ryan next week as the iPhone maker tries to strengthen its relationships with key Republicans — despite its decision to pull support for the GOP convention because of its distaste for Donald Trump.Cook will help generate cash for Ryan at a private breakfast on June 28 in Menlo Park, Calif., along with Gary Wipfler, the company’s treasurer, according to an invite obtained by POLITICO on Monday. The money benefits not only the speaker but a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans.Cook is hosting the fundraiser on his own accord, as Apple does not have a corporate political action committee like Facebook, Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley. Still, the move reflects Apple’s desire to court Republican and Democratic officeholders alike, even at a time when it has serious reservations about Trump, the GOPs presumptive presidential nominee.Trumps incendiary remarks about women, immigrants and minorities led Apple to decide against donating cash and technology to the GOPs convention in Cleveland next month, according to two sources, who revealed the company’s thinking to POLITICO on Saturday. Apple had provided such aid to Democratic and Republican nominating events in previous years.A company spokesman declined to comment for this story.The Trump campaign has not commented on Apples convention decision, which marks a break with other tech giants, like Facebook and Google, which have said they will provide support to the Republican nominating event this year. Trump has taken repeated shots at Apple and Cook, even calling for a boycott of the companys products over its stance on encryption.Trump aside, Cook long has sought to improve his company’s relationships with Democrats and Republicans — a far different approach than that of Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who disdained Washington.Cook donated to Barack Obama during his first White House run. In 2015, he donated cash to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a vocal Apple ally during the company’s fight with the government over the way it priced its e-books. That same year, the Apple CEO wrote a personal check to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who shares the iPhone maker’s views on surveillance reform. And in 2016, Cook backed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a leading tech policy advocate who represents a slice of the Bay Area.On the Republican side, Cook has been just as active. When the Apple CEO visited Washington in May 2015, he huddled with leading Republicans, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), to talk patent reform and other issues. In August, Cook hosted a fundraiser for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a major ally in the company’s calls for tax reform, in Atherton, Calif., according to an invite obtained by POLITICO. From a border wall with Mexico to a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to a warmer embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, Vice President Joe Biden sees Donald Trump’s foreign policy as problematic at best and damaging at worst.The vice president said as much Monday afternoon in a speech to the Center for New American Security’s Annual Conference in downtown Washington, excerpts of which were released Monday morning. Biden drew a contrast between the progress he said he and President Barack Obama have made over the last seven years and Trump’s proposals, which the vice president painted as backwards-facing.But if we turn inward, undermine our most important relationships, or seek sound bite solutions in a world defined by complexity, Biden said. If we forget who we are, betray our values, and embrace intolerance. We will squander all of our hard-earned progress.Biden said building a border wall would disrespect our neighbors and heighten anti-American feelings in the Western hemisphere. Listing global challenges like climate change, radicalism, and health epidemics, Biden said, no matter what others may claim, we cannot wall ourselves off from these challenges.On China, a nation with which Trump said the U.S. makes bad deals, Biden will say cooperation is essential and to resort to confrontation would make life harder for billions of people. The vice president bragged about his close working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and spoke of private working dinners with Xi during which Biden asserted Americas role as a Pacific power and suggested China has been a beneficiary of Americas presence in the region.Biden also defended as essential the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal of the variety that Trump has regularly bashed on the campaign trail. Deepening ties economic ties in the Pacific is crucial, Biden said, to an array of American interests.It is as much a foreign policy initiative as it is an economic initiative as it is an economic initiative, Biden said of the controversial trade deal. We’re not there, China will fill the vacuum, just by the sheer weight and size. And it will not be in our interest.Biden had especially harsh words for Trump’s terrorism policy proposals and his plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. He characterized the GOP nominees campaign as wielding the politics of fear and intolerance and mirrored Obama’s refrain that the U.S. must be careful not to disaffect the world’s Muslims while combating extremism.There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world. Some of the rhetoric I’m hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion, Biden said. How do we win this? How do we win this long term fight without embracing, engaging and having allies in the Islamic community in the United States, among American citizens and immigrants? How do we do this without allies in the Muslim world?Alienating 1.5 billion Muslims, the vast, vast majority of whom, at home and abroad, are peace-loving, it doesn’t make the situation better. It makes it worse. And it plays into the very narrative of the extremists, Biden said, using an alternate estimation of the number of Muslims in the world. Why in God’s name are we giving them what they want? And besides, we are so much better than that. Whether its Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, the next president will need to deal with setting aside defense cuts as part of sequestration, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday, though he gave an indication as to which gender he expects the 45th commander in chief to be.The next president, whoever he or she — most likely she — is going to be, needs to get these defense cuts set aside, Graham remarked during a discussion at the Center for a New American Securitys conference.Graham also took a shot at Trump, his former presidential primary rival, in discussing the spectrum of Republican viewpoints on defense. The bottom line: I think there’s a fight within the Republican Party for who we are on foreign policy, from the Rand Paul view to the Lindsey Graham, John McCain view, Graham said. And Trump’s somewhere out there, somewhere saying something, I don’t know where he’s at. So, so, I think there’s a more traditional view of foreign policy emerging on the Republican side. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to run for president.Graham has been one of the most vocal critics of Trumps candidacy, most recently urging his fellow Republicans to un-endorse their partys presumptive nominee after his comments attacking a federal judge.There will be a desire by all of us to help the next president, whoever he or she may be, Graham said. And I would advise the next president, if it’s Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, to start — give [Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.)] and me and other people a call about rebuilding the Defense Department, setting aside sequestration. I may be wrong, but I think there’d be a pretty large audience for that.                 Priorities USA Action - a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC - is targeting Donald Trump in battleground states.  GettyThe main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign had its biggest month of 2016 in May, bringing in $12.1 million — $3.5 million more than the previous month — as the now-presumptive Democratic nominee neared the nomination in her primary battle against Bernie Sanders and started taking on Donald Trump.Priorities USA Action started June sitting on roughly $52 million in cash on hand after bringing in roughly $88 million, with commitments of another $45 million, for the election cycle, the group told POLITICO on Monday.May’s haul — led by $3 million from Chicago media executive Fred Eychaner — comes as the group is engaged in a major anti-Trump ad onslaught in eight battleground states that’s expected to last until election day: it has reserved roughly $147 million between television, radio, and digital platforms. Looking to project an aggressive posture against the presumptive GOP nominee, it added North Carolina — a state Barack Obama won in 2008 but not 2012 — to its buys earlier this month, expanding its list from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Virginia.In the last few weeks Donald Trump accused President Obama of working with ISIS, took a victory lap following a national tragedy, and mimed shooting someone at one of his events, said Priorities’ chief strategist, Guy Cecil. Priorities USA is not going to let this man anywhere near the White House because he is far too dangerous and divisive to ever be President of the United States. We will not let up in our efforts to defeat him this November, and are grateful for our continued fundraising success.The group’s television ads have thus far sought to paint Trump as divisive and dangerous, pointing out his harsh rhetoric about women and zeroing in on his mocking of a reporter’s disabilities by featuring an Ohio couple whose daughter has spina bifida. A new spot released on Sunday describes him as too dangerous for America, quoting him on foreign policy.Clinton’s campaign has also started bombarding the real estate developer with ads in the same eight swing states, but Trump has thus far not responded in kind — and the constellation of super PACs surrounding Trump have yet to make significant moves either. Donald Trumps ousted campaign manager stayed loyal to his boss even after his firing Monday, as Corey Lewandowski did multiple cable TV interviews Monday in which he praised his boss, rejected reports of internal discord within the campaign and continued to project the campaigns message.I had a nice conversation with Mr. Trump and said to him, its been an honor and privilege to be part of this and I mean that for the bottom of my heart, Lewandowski told CNNs Dana Bash. I think as you look at how small this team has been and how close knit this team has been, its really important to know there are highs and lows in every campaign and weve been through them together and we need to continue with the [Republican National Committee] to utilize the resources they have available to us. Its been a great privilege, and look, I wouldnt change one second.Asked why he was fired, Lewandowski said that he did not know.One of the raps on you is that you fed his worst instincts, Bash said. Anybody who knows me and has known me over a long period of time knows Im a very straight shooter, Lewandowski replied, calling it a characteristic that has worked to his own detriment on many occasions.I tell people the way it is, whether it’s good or bad or indifferent. Because I always say Im not smart enough to lie, ‘cause I cant remember the lie I told. So what I say is I give you my best opinion and recommendation. That my duty and obligation to anybody I work for, whether it’s Mr. Trump or a different company, he continued. All I can do is give my best advice and counsel. Doesn’t mean it’s right, doesn’t mean it’s wrong. But I’m going to give you my best advice and if my best advice is something you agree with, great. And if you disagree, thats OK, too. And we have had many conversations where Mr. Trump and I have either agreed or disagreed but at the end of the day, I dont take it personally. I just give my best advice, and that’s the job of any good staffer.As far as whether he felt surprised or blindsided by the decision, Lewandowski demurred.I dont know if its so much of that. Its been a lot of conjecture in the media lately about whats going on well and what isnt going on well in the campaign, Lewandowski told CNN. I think a lot of that is just the media trying to hype up a campaign, he said in reference to Hillary Clinton.Trump does not get proper attention or credit, Lewandowski suggested. Even when he gives a great policy speech, hes probably the best speaker that our country has ever seen for a presidential candidate, the ousted manager said.I think what you have is an opportunity to expand. Mr. Trump brought millions of people into the Republican Party. We see independents who haven’t voted in 20 or 30 years coming out, massive rallies, crowds, Lewandowski said in an interview aired on MSNBC.Look, those people are so energized. So I think it’s very important. But what are you going up against now is a Hillary Clinton machine, it’s four more years of Obama administration. They’ve got a massive operation, they’ve got, you know, I think she’s raised $800 million so far. Theyre going to have all the resources in the world to go and talk about the liberal agenda.Were you escorted out of the building by security today? Bash asked, to which the former campaign manager responded, It doesnt work like that. Obviously, there are protocols in place so when someone is no longer an employee, theres no escorting out. Look, Ive had the privilege of working with these people for 19 months. Theyre friends of mine but theres a protocol and everyone follows the same protocol regardless of who it is and I think thats the right thing.It wasnt security; it was a friend from the office, Lewandowski said.Asked about a tweet from Michael Caputo, Trumps New York state director, which alluded to his firing by comparing him to the Wicked Witch of the East, Lewandowski chalked it up to the nature of the campaign.Talk to the people who have been here from the beginning, he told CNN. The people who have been in the trenches, who understand and have seen Mr. Trumps work ethic and what hes been able to accomplish whether its new Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa, those states where no one gave him a chance and he became successful and became the Republican nominee. I think if you asked them, theyd stand toe to toe with me any day of the week and 20 hours a day to make sure that they had the same work ethic I do and I think thats what I try to foster with the people Ive worked with. On reports that Trumps family played a role in orchestrating his ouster, particularly Ivanka Trumps husband, Jared Kushner, Lewandowski was dubious to both MSNBC and CNN.I can say Ive had a great relationship with the family and I think I continue to do so, Lewandowski remarked too CNN. Look. Everybody has their own opinions and I think what you have is a transition in the campaign from a very, very successful 37-state primary victory process managed at a one-off level ... to look to a bigger picture. Thats okay. Theres nothing wrong with that. More ideas, people giving iput, thats great, important. Im an implementer. Thats what I try to do. Take the ideas laid out and implement them to the best of our ability and most important thing and that includes the kids input, other professionals input, it includes elected officials, it includes the D.C. peoples input. I try to implement what the collective organization is best for the campaign.On Kushner specifically, Lewandowski said he has had a great relationship, and Im not sure where thats coming from.Ivanka Trump? Bash asked. Great asset to the campaign, Lewandowski said.Bash followed up, Would you be surprised if you heard she was not thrilled with the job that you were doing?I dont think thats the case, Lewandowski said. I think Ivanka is somebody who understands her father and a fantastic surrogate for this campaign, she brings a sense of calmness to the campaign. She has a way about her that she connects immediately not just with women but with business executives. Shes so polished, so professional. Its been an honor to be able work with her for the last 18 months.Asked his biggest regret, Lewandowski was unequivocal: None professionally.None? Thats not even — I know that youre human, Bash said, touching Lewandowskis arm. Theres flesh and blood. Youve got to have some regrets.Overall, Lewandowski said his biggest regret was not being able to have my family more involved.My family lives in New Hampshire. Ive got four young children, he remarked. Campaigns are so all-consuming, theyre so time consuming, its difficult to go home and explain what your day was like.But that is not a regret at all, Lewandowski was quick to add.I have no regrets as it comes to this campaign. Ive been given such an opportunity and a privilege and if somebody said to me 18 months ago, youll be managing the candidate through 37 state victories, 14 million votes, more votes than anyone in the history of the Republican Party, I’d say, is that possible? Look what hes been able to achieve and Im a small part of that, Lewandowski said. So I have no regrets at all. Corey Lewandowski has been fired as Donald Trumps campaign manager, ending the tenure of the fiery operative who faced steady string of controversies while guiding Trumps skeleton campaign operation to a shocking victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign, spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The New York Times, which reported the news on Monday. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.A senior Trump aide confirms Lewandowski was fired by the campaign.On CNN Monday, Lewandowski told Dana Bash that he spoke with Trump personally in his firing — calling it a nice conversation — and said that he still supported Trump. He also said he did not know why hed been fired.Another source briefed on the departure said Trumps adult children have been pushing for Lewandowskis ouster since he was accused of assaulting then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Ivanka Trump, especially, was said to be concerned about the effect of Lewandowski on the Trump family brand. (Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks pushed back on the assertion that Trumps family influenced the decision.) It’s unclear when the decision came down, but it seems to have surprised Lewandowski and his allies in and around the campaign. One campaign official who was hired by Lewandowski said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss. It was a good chat, the official said.Still, the campaign that morning removed Lewandowski from a scheduled appearance on Fox News Sunday, instead dispatching prominent Trump backer Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.Another source, however, says the personal affinity between Lewandowski and Trump, built up over the year-long run to the top of the GOP, remains intact despite the firing.And in a statement Monday, Lewandowski reaffirmed his support for his now-former boss. I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hilary Clinton ever will be, he said.The now-former campaign manager had worked for Trumps campaign since it launched last June, but he had clashed with campaign chairman Paul Manafort since Manafort was brought on board this spring.The senior Trump aide said the decision to oust Lewandowski stemmed from necessity, faulting Lewandowski for not getting along with the Republican National Committee and for Trumps operation falling behind Hillary Clinton from an infrastructure perspective. There was recognition, the aide said, that Lewandowski was no longer up to the job. According to another source, Lewandowskis departure comes amid a sense of disorder within the campaign and Lewandowski taking much of the blame for it. The source said he was under fire for blocking hires, refusing to install more traditional elements of the campaign and generally causing friction.Lewandowskis critics openly celebrated his ouster.Michael Caputo, a Trump adviser and Manafort ally within the campaign, appears to have mocked Lewandowski on Twitter. He tweeted out a still image from the movie The Wizard of Oz showing the witch buried under Dorothys house and linking to a YouTube video featuring the Ding dong, the witch is dead song from the film.Jim Baker, who served as Trumps state director for multiple states before being fired by Lewandowski in May (some say for recognizing Manaforts authority above the campaign manager’s), texted Lewandowski a mocking job offer as soon as news of his firing broke. The offer: Hey bud, I see youre looking for work now - I may be willing to have you interview for a field rep position I have open in Binghamton. Baker now manages the congressional campaign of independent candidate Martin Babinec in New Yorks 22nd district. He said Lewandowski has not yet responded.With Lewandowski out, Manafort is the de facto head of the campaign, Trump adviser Barry Bennett said Monday on Fox News. But Bennett said the change at the top would not significantly alter Trumps strategy. I dont think well see dramatic changes, he said. I wouldnt call it a pivot, because that makes it sound like it’s a big move. The campaign has always been about the Mexican heroin problem and schools that dont work and government that is wasteful and people who cant find jobs and no one is getting a raise. That’s kind of things this campaign has been about over a year. We need to talk about that more for sure.Upon news of Lewandowskis departure, Fields, now a reporter for the Huffington Post, tweeted, Hey @CLewandowski_ I hear @BreitbartNews is hiringFields worked for Breitbart News until March, when she and the outlets editor-at-large left the company over how it handled an incident the previous week in Florida at which Lewandowski grabbed Fields arm to move her away from Trump as she tried to answer a question. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery but the state declined to prosecute.Ben Schreckinger, Ken Vogel, Patrick Reis and Shane Goldmacher contributed to this report.                 John Kerry said Donald Trumps ideas dont match the fundamental values of protecting people.  GettySecretary of State John Kerry tore into Donald Trump’s policy proposals on the commemoration of World Refugee Day, suggesting that the presumptive Republican nominees ideas deviate from the fundamental values of protecting people.But there is usually a very strong guideline with respect to fundamental values of dealing with refugees to fundamental values of protecting people. And, trying to make a difference and I think traditionally, Republican presidents, Democratic presidents alike have applied those standards, Kerry told a group of college students on Monday, without mentioning Trump by name. This is the first campaign that I can think of where there has been as a dramatic variant in some of the proposals, without getting specific.The White House also released a statement that took a veiled shot at Trumps rhetoric, which intensified last week after the June 12 shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Speaking to CBS Face the Nation in an interview aired Sunday, Trump said he hates the concept of profiling but would be willing to do so in response to recent terrorist attacks. Trump previously called on a temporary ban of all Muslim immigration, including from majority Muslim countries.We will continue to alleviate the suffering of refugees abroad, and to welcome them here at home, because doing so reflects our American values and our noblest traditions as a Nation, enriches our society, and strengthens our collective security, President Barack Obama said in a statement. Their lives and their many accomplishments stand as a clear rebuke to the bigotry and brutality they fled, and serve as a powerful example of the human will to endure, hope, and achieve. President Barack Obama endorsed LinkedIn as a job search tool Monday, joking that he would use the professional social media network to seek employment after he leaves the White House.America is an extraordinary place to do business, Obama said, after ticking through a list of facts that support that statement.As he frequently does when speaking to younger people, Obama made the case that if given the choice to live in any era — not knowing what your gender, ethnicity or class would be — you would choose right now.You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history, he said in his keynote address at the Washington Hilton for the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit. Less violent. Less driven by division. You’d choose today.Obama touted the country’s steady rate of private sector job growth, high school graduation rate, percentage of Americans insured under Obamacare, slow growth of health care costs and high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field.Our rule of law, our mature capital markets — all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business, Obama added. Now that’s a pretty good sales pitch. I don’t mind being America’s pitchman, and in seven months or so — in seven months or so, I’ll be on the job market, and I’m glad I’m gonna be here. I’m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.In February, the president posted on LinkedIn about his first summer job scooping ice cream to announce a summer job initiative for young people.My first summer job wasn’t exactly glamorous, but it taught me some valuable lessons. Responsibility. Hard work. Balancing a job with friends, family, and school, Obama wrote. We’re kicking off a Summer Opportunity Project that brings together state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses — including LinkedIn — to get young people into their first jobs and create strong transitions between school years and from high school to college and careers.                 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during a rally at Louisville Slugger Fields Hall of Fame Pavilion in Louisville, Ky., Tuesday, May 10.   AP PhotoHillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 7 percentage points, according to a new poll — one of the latest national surveys to show the presumptive Republican presidential nominee badly trailing his likely Democratic opponent.Clinton earned 47 percent support in the new Monmouth University poll released Monday, while Trump took 40 percent in a head-to-head matchup omitting third-party challengers. Another 5 percent said they would support another candidate, while 6 percent said they are undecided and 2 percent said who said they would not support anyone or declined to respond. And the numbers only get worse for Trump: Nearly six in 10 registered voters said that stopping him from getting elected president is important. And though nearly half said the same of Clinton, her advantage is undiminished when the survey sample narrows.Among voters who described themselves as likely, for instance, Clinton leads by eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent. And in the 10 states where the margin of victory in the 2012 presidential election was less than seven points, Clinton leads 47 percent to 39 percent.Monmouth conducted the poll from June 15-19, days after an Islamic State sympathizer slaughtered 49 and wounded dozens more at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump has responded to that attack by repeating his call to indefinitely ban Muslims from entering the United States, criticizing Clinton and President Barack Obama for their weak response to radical Islamist terrorism. Clinton has called for an intelligence surge and ripped Trumps comments as unpresidential.The Monmouth poll is only the latest in a series of recent national polls showing Trump trailing Clinton. A Bloomberg poll released last Tuesday showed Clinton with a 12-point lead of 49 percent to 37 percent, while Trump himself tweeted a poll last Friday showing him losing to Clinton by only two points. The RealClearPolitics national average shows Clinton ahead by nearly 6 percentage points — a gap that has only widened since late May.Trumps polling woes have added to a sense of siege inside his operation, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski ousted Monday morning after clashing with family members and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.In the Monmouth survey, Clinton leads Trump head-to-head with independents (42 percent to 37 percent), women, and people of all ages, between 18 and 34 (54 percent to 34 percent), 35 and 54 (47 percent to 39 percent) and leads within the margin of error among those 55 and older (44 percent to 43 percent). Trump leads among Republicans (84 percent to 8 percent) and in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 (50 percent to 37 percent).In a four-way matchup with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clintons lead over Trump narrows slightly, 42 percent to 36 percent. Johnson, meanwhile, earned 9 percent, Stein took 4 percent, with 2 percent saying they would support another candidate, 4 percent saying they are undecided among those candidates and 1 percent who said they would not support anyone or refused to respond. Among independents in a four-way race, Trump leads Clinton 32 percent to 31 percent, with Johnson pulling in 18 percent and Stein at 8 percent.Among registered voters, 49 percent overall said it is very important that Trump not become president, while another 10 percent called it somewhat important. On the other hand, 8 percent said it was not too important and 31 percent said it was not at all important. The results break down unsurprising partisan lines, with 89 percent of Democrats ascribing some degree of importance to denying Trump the White House and 76 percent of Republican registered voters who said the opposite. For Clinton, 41 percent said it is very important that she not become president, while 10 percent said it was somewhat important. Another 11 percent said it was not too important and 35 percent said it was not at all important. While 89 percent of Republicans said it was important for Clinton not to be president, 83 percent of Democrats said it was not important to some degree.Nearly seven in 10, or 69 percent, said they are certain about their vote in November, while 18 percent said they might change their mind and 13 percent said they are undecided.Less than one-third of registered voters said they have a favorable opinion of Trump, at just 28 percent to 57 percent unfavorable. Clinton did not fare much better, with 36 percent saying they have a favorable opinion of her and 52 percent who said they did not.Voters preferred Clinton over Trump on matters of the economy and jobs (47 percent to 44 percent) as well as on who they most trusted to handle the threat of terrorism on U.S. soil (46 percent to 44 percent).Asked whether they supported banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., similar to Trumps temporary ban, 70 percent said they were opposed and 21 percent said they would support.Trump tweaked his proposed Muslim ban last week to say that the U.S. needs to look at banning immigration from countries where there has been a history of anti-Western terrorism, though voters seemed reluctant to support that idea as well. While 34 percent said they would support such a measure, nearly six in 10, or 57 percent, opposed.Via landlines and cellphones, Monmouth surveyed 803 registered voters drawn from a list of registered voters and through random-digit dialing. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.                 The Democratic National Committee issued a statement blasting Donald Trump as the problem after he fired his campaign manager.  GettyDonald Trump may have fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday, but the Democratic National Committee suggested that the presumptive Republican nominee need only look in the mirror to find the person most responsible for his problems.Corey Lewandowski is not the problem, it’s Donald Trump, national press secretary Mark Paustenbach said in a statement, noting in particular the candidates call to temporarily ban Muslims from the country and his comments pertaining to a judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuits. It wasn’t Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was Donald Trump. It wasn’t Corey Lewandowski who disparaged a federal judge born in Indiana because his parents were ‘Mexican’, it was Donald Trump.News of Lewandowskis firing does nothing to make up for Trump’s divisive and racist comments and policies, Paustenbach concluded. It does reinforce, however, that there’s no one Trump won’t throw overboard for his own personal benefit, just as he’s done his entire life. Trumps campaign manager faced a series of controversies and internal campaign conflicts throughout the primary season even as the candidate racked up victory after victory. The FBI released a partial transcript on Monday of a 911 call terrorist Omar Mateen made from inside Orlando’s Pulse nightclub during his June 12 attack that killed 49 people, though it declined to release audio from the incident.The partial transcript is redacted to remove portions of Mateen’s pledges of allegiance to the Islamic State, a move intended to minimize the value of the calls as propaganda for the militant group. The FBI also did not release audio of the calls, which U.S. Attorney Lee Bentley said was meant to avoid revictimizing those who were inside the nightclub.Mateen identified himself as the gunman in his call to 911, according to the FBI transcript, and spoke in both Arabic and English. Twice asked for his name by the 911 operator, Mateen would only reply with his pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The name of the militant group was removed from the transcripts by the FBI.Part of the redacting is meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said at a news conference. We’re not going to propagate their rhetoric, their violent rhetoric, and we see no value in putting those individuals’ names back out there. We’re trying to prevent future acts from happening again and for cowards like this one, people like that influence them.Hopper confirmed that there is no indication that Mateen received direction for his attack from the Islamic State or any other terrorist group. Hopper was careful to differentiate between Islam and what he called the perverted view of the religion that inspired the Orlando gunman, hewing closely to similar language used by President Barack Obama to describe terrorist attacks.But House Speaker Paul Ryan objected to the redactions and called on the Department of Justice and the Obama administration to release the full transcripts.Selectively editing this transcript is preposterous. We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS, Ryan said in a statement, referring to the Islamic State by another common name for the group. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript to the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why.Hopper also described the shooter’s tone as chilling, calm and deliberate and said that although the audio was compelling, its release would be excruciatingly painful for victims.Bentley, Hopper and other law enforcement officials did not answer questions pertaining to the ongoing investigation into the shooting. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is scheduled to travel to Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday to receive an on-the-ground briefing from law enforcement on that investigation.                 Rep. Mo Brooks said Muslims would kill every homosexual in the country if they could.  GettyRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) on Thursday said that Muslims would kill every homosexual in the United States of America if they could, after suggesting that Democrats are trying to appeal to both the LGBT community and the Muslim community.On the one hand, they’re trying to appeal to the gay community, but, on the other hand, they’re trying to also appeal to the Muslim community, which, if it had its way, would kill every homosexual in the United States of America, the Republican lawmaker said while being interviewed on the Matt & Aunie show, a radio program on Birmingham, Alabamas Talk 99.5 FM, as first reported by BuzzFeed News. The statement came after Brooks was asked why Democrats fail to address mainstream Muslim thought that calls for the death of gay people, days after Omar Mateen opened fire at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people.Brooks also said, It’s pretty clear that the Islamic doctrine says that you are to kill homosexuals where you find them.

AP PhotoMinutes after news broke that Donald Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was no longer with the campaign, one of the presumptive Republican nominees top advisers and surrogates took to Twitter to celebrate.Ding dong the witch is dead, tweeted Michael Caputo, a senior adviser and the director of Trumps New York campaign, along with a photo of vanquished Wicked Witch of the East from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and a YouTube link to the song.Ding dong the witch is dead! https://t.co/pSqQwmAGz1 pic.twitter.com/5dE7GMeEK6— Michael Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) June 20, 2016Lewandowskis departure follows months of reported infighting in the campaign between his allies and those of campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Caputo is seen as a Manafort ally within the campaign.                 Republicans are hoping they will be celebrating like the Cleveland Cavaliers once the election is over.  GettyThe Republican National Committee is hoping the Cavaliers are not the only winners from Cleveland this summer.The partys Twitter account congratulated the Cavaliers on Twitter on Monday morning for winning the NBA championship over the Golden State Warriors and predicted more success from the city in the coming months. Congrats to the @cavs! This team is just the first winner Cleveland will produce this summer! it tweeted, in a message quickly retweeted by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.The Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland next month, where Donald Trump looks to officially win the nomination.The Cavaliers’ deep run in the playoffs, however, did pose a bit of a challenge for the GOP, which had to wait the maximum length of the series to begin setting up for the convention at the teams Quicken Loans Arena. As the Cavaliers kept winning, the Republican Party was unable to begin preparations for the convention, as The New York Times reported last Friday, a day after the teams final possible home game.                 AP PhotoThe Supreme Court will let stand bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York, laws passed in the wake of a 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.The court’s decision Monday to reject separate challenges to each state’s law leaves in place measures that ban weapons like the one used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children and six faculty members dead. Those laws also prohibit the sale of the type of gun used by terrorist Omar Mateen to kill 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.The June 12 terrorist attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub has prompted renewed calls for gun control legislation, but the debate has centered mostly on banning individuals on a terrorist no-fly list from purchasing weapons. The discussion has largely avoided calls for a fresh ban on assault weapons, which were banned for a decade and only became legal again in 2004. Connecticut and New York are two of seven states that ban assault weapons, along with the District of Columbia.The high court’s decisions not to hear the two cases, Shew v. Malloy for Connecticut and Kampfer v. Cuomo for New York, are the latest in a string of such rejections. The Supreme Court has not heard a case pertaining to second-amendment rights since 2010, when it overturned a Chicago law banning handguns.  Spurred by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, the Senate will vote Monday on a quartet of bills to prevent terrorists from buying weapons and overhaul the national background check system for firearms purchases.But the chamber’s big gun show on Monday is expected to be just that: political theater.All four proposals are reheated versions of legislation the Senate rejected in the past. Despite a flurry of negotiations over the past week, and some movement among centrist Republicans toward a compromise that continued over the weekend, there’s little indication the outcome will be any different this time.The Republicans have to look at themselves in the mirror and they have to look at their constituents in the eye this November, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said on a recent conference call with reporters. They hear the same messages we do from thousands and thousands of their constituents, just as we do from ours.The Senate will take a series of roll-call votes at 5:30 p.m. Monday.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are sponsoring different versions of legislation to flag suspected terrorists trying to buy guns and reform the background check system.But negotiations between party leaders on something that could actually pass with significant bipartisan support fell apart last week. The National Rifle Association backed a bill from GOP leaders that Democrats won’t accept. Democrats mounted a high-profile filibuster to press for more gun regulations — a deeply politicized response, in Republicans’ view.The uncertainty that remains is whether centrists in either party can craft a deal and sell it to their leaders — which aides on both sides of the aisle say is a long shot.Instead, Monday’s votes will be all about gaining political advantage in the November election and positioning each party for any effort to take up gun restrictions in 2017, when a group of red-state Democrats will be facing reelection the following year.But this fall, Democrats plan to accuse vulnerable Republicans of being more interested in doing the NRA’s bidding than making the country safe. Republicans counter that Democrats are the ones exploiting a tragedy, the killing of 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.The leader of the filibuster, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said the effort led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to draft a compromise bill on preventing potential terrorists from buying guns would not have happened without his nearly 15-hour speech.There is consensus here, Murphy said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. None of that would’ve been happening if we didn’t stand up and conduct that filibuster. We were just going to go on, like business as usual.But Republicans say Democrats have already gone too far by forcing GOP senators to vote against Democratic measures — and then, in all likelihood, turn the votes into fodder for ads against Republicans.I understand what Chuck Schumer’s motivation is, said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), whose efforts to find a middle ground were brusquely shrugged off by the same Democratic senators working to oust him from his Senate seat this fall.Behind the scenes, several Republicans are working with centrist Democrats on a compromise that could pass the Senate. Collins backs a bill that would create a narrow list of suspected terrorists who would be barred outright from buying firearms. Her measure would also set up a broader list of suspected terrorists that would be used to notify federal authorities if someone on the bigger list tried to purchase a gun.Those negotiations continued over the weekend, and even some conservatives seemed hopeful.Susan is so careful about those things and she’s worked really hard to figure out the differences in various lists and what kind of proof it takes to get on that list, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday. Some way we should be able to make this work.But Republican leaders have already allowed four votes on gun measures for Monday — that alone was a win for Democrats given the limited calendar time and proximity to the election. Republicans are growing tired of responding to the Democratic minority on an issue that could be troublesome for them in blue and purple states.Republicans would rather turn the scrutiny away from themselves and on to President Barack Obama, who they argue has failed to effectively respond to the Islamic State, the genesis of the terrorism threat against the United States.We’d like to actually talk about the real cause of that attack, and that is a terrorist attack on our own soil, and why the policies both in the Middle East and here at home are inadequate to deal with the threat of homegrown radicalization, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).The votes on Monday evening are likely to break on familiar partisan lines.The first two will focus broadly on background checks for gun sales. That issue stymied the Democratic-led Senate in 2013, which could not advance legislation just months after 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has a proposal meant to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System by boosting its funding and trying to make it easier for the system to gain records it doesn’t already have. The measure would also revise legal definitions on who is barred from owning a gun due to mental-health considerations.As a counter, Senate Democrats, led by Murphy, are pushing a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales by private sellers, including at gun shows and over the Internet. It’s similar to legislation written by Toomey with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that did not pass in 2013. The Democratic plan also has provisions to bolster the records kept by the background checks system.By making the bill different than the one supported by Toomey, a senior GOP aide argued the proposal is intentionally partisan. Toomey is likely to oppose Murphys background checks because it is more restrictive than the 2013 universal background checks bill. The final pair of votes is likely to get more attention in light of the Orlando shootings and the massacre in San Bernardino, California, which were both primarily carried out by U.S. citizens who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.The Democratic plan, written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), would allow the Justice Department to block sales of guns to people who are suspected of having terrorist ties. Republicans have said Feinstein’s proposal would intrude on the Second Amendment rights of those who are wrongly included on federal terror watch lists. Meanwhile, the GOP plan drafted by Cornyn would halt a sale only if a judge found probable cause that the person trying to buy the gun is involved in terrorist activities. Democrats say that burden of proof is too high.All of the proposals need 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to advance. In December, just one Senate Democrat voted against Feinstein’s plan, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. The moderate senator, who is up for reelection in 2018 and has been a source of deep frustration for gun-control advocates, has not signaled she will change her mind.Just one Republican voted with the rest of the Democrats in December: Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who has perhaps the toughest reelection race among incumbent GOP senators this fall. He issued a news release Friday touting himself as a co-author of the Feinstein plan. The NRA is keeping the pressure on Republicans to hold the line. In an interview on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday, the groups vice president and chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, called the Democratic push for new gun restrictions an intentional distraction.Trying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex, LaPierre said. And this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that’s not going to solve the problem.                 An analysis by Moodys said that under almost any scenario, a Donald Trump presidency would diminish the American economy.  GettyDonald Trump’s presidency would significantly weaken the country, driving the U.S. into a lengthy recession with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody’s Analytics analysis released Monday. The analysis examined the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s economic plans at face value, based on interviews, speeches and his campaign website. The authors of the report, however, warned that quantifying the real estate mogul’s economic polices is complicated by their lack of specificity.Broadly, Mr. Trump’s economic proposals will result in a more isolated U.S. economy. Cross-border trade and immigration will be significantly diminished, and with less trade and immigration, foreign direct investment will also be reduced, Mark Zandi, Chris Lafakis, Dan White and Adam Ozimek wrote in the report. His policies would also diminish the country’s growth prospects, grow federal government deficits, increase the nation’s debt and finance his mix of much lower tax revenues and few cuts in spending with substantially more government borrowing.Driven largely by these factors, the economy will be significantly weaker if Mr. Trump’s economic proposals are adopted. Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office, the authors wrote. By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7%, compared with below 5% today. During Mr. Trump’s presidency, the average American household’s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline.The report also determined that Trump’s plans would hit the middle class the hardest while high-income earners would benefit the most from his tax breaks.Everyone receives a tax cut under his proposals, but the bulk of the cuts would go to those at the very top of the income distribution, and the job losses resulting from his other policies would likely hit lower- and middle-income households the hardest, the report said. The decline in wealth caused by weaker stock prices and housing values would be felt by all households. Even allowing for some variability in the accuracy of the economic modeling and underlying assumptions that drive the analysis, four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached: 1) they will result in a less global U.S. economy; 2) they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; 3) they will largely benefit very high-income households; and 4) they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment, the report stated.Trumps campaign did not respond when asked to comment on the analysis. The analysis acknowledges that presidential candidates often put forth proposals that are as much political statements as firm policy positions, adding that candidates don’t anticipate their proposals to go through the legislative process fully intact and that Trump’s policies should be viewed in that capacity.Nevertheless, what he is asking for is fiscally unsound, the authors concluded. His tax and spending proposals will result in very large deficits and a much higher debt load. A future Congress may be able to rein in this profligacy, but it will not be easy, as there is a gulf between what he says he wants on taxes and spending and what it will take to make the budget arithmetic work, they wrote. He is also very suspicious of globalization. His willingness to threaten higher tariffs on U.S. trading partners and his sharp criticism of major trade deals signal a reversal on the long-running expansion of U.S. trade and foreign investment. Requiring millions of undocumented immigrants to leave the country also signals less openness to the rest of the world.Under almost any scenario, according to the analysis, the result of Trump’s economic policy positions is that the U.S. economy will be more isolated and diminished.Moody’s Analytics will also release an analysis of Hillary Clinton’s proposals. NEW YORK — Big Wall Street donors have a message for Hillary Clinton: Keep Elizabeth Warren off the ticket or risk losing millions of dollars in contributions.In a dozen interviews, major Democratic donors in the financial services industry said they saw little chance that Clinton would pick the liberal firebrand as her vice presidential nominee. These donors despise Warren’s attacks on the financial industry. But they also think her selection would be damaging to the economy. And they warned that if Clinton surprises them and taps Warren, big donations from the industry could vanish.If Clinton picked Warren, her whole base on Wall Street would leave her, said one top Democratic donor who has helped raise millions for Clinton. They would literally just say, ‘We have no qualms with you moving left, we understand all the things you’ve had to do because of Bernie Sanders, but if you are going there with Warren, we just can’t trust you, you’ve killed it.’Most big donors don’t want Warren on the ticket because she is the most accomplished anti-Wall Street populist in the Democratic Party. But many also think her presence would drive a potential Clinton administration too far to the left, poison relations with the private sector from the start and ultimately be damaging to the economy.A constant theme that emerged in the interviews is that executives in the financial industry believe the first 100 days of a Clinton administration could feature potential deal making with Republicans, who are likely to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives.The dream deal for Wall Street would be a combination of targeted infrastructure spending that appeals mostly to Democrats and corporate and international tax reform that could bring Republicans along. The fear is that Warren would make such a deal more difficult.Clinton is going to face a divided government unless there is a total tsunami, said one moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry. What you want in a vice president is someone who can negotiate for you on the Hill, someone like Joe Biden. And that is not a Warren strength.All of the donors and senior Democrats interviewed for this story demanded that their names not be used both because they were not authorized to speak about the Clinton campaign’s internal deliberations and because they feared Warren’s wrath. There is no upside to my talking to you on the record, one big donor said. Either I piss off the Clinton campaign or I piss off Warren, or both.Several donors said they did not really fear Warren going on the ticket because they do not believe Clinton has a strong relationship with the senator and would not trust Warren to be a loyal No. 2, either on the campaign or in the White House.First of all, they don’t particularly like each other, said one prominent hedge fund manager who has raised millions for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton before her. But, the manager added, The absolute predicate for a vice presidential nominee is they have to understand they are No. 2 both during the campaign and once you take office, and I just don’t think Elizabeth Warren is that type of person.The distaste for Warren in the banking industry is not surprising. No American politician in recent history has done more to harness the powerful anti-Wall Street sentiment that continues to rage in the country since the financial crisis of 2008.Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that many bankers dislike, and she continues to push for far stronger regulations including breaking up the nation’s largest financial institutions into smaller, simpler pieces. This is exactly the reason that many on the left, including ardent backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, want to see Warren on the ticket.It’s very clear that Wall Street guys don’t like her because she has been a lot more effective than most in communicating an anti-Wall Street message that has been part of the Democratic Party for 80 years, since the 1930s, said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College. It’s not so much that Wall Street doesn’t like her personally, most of them don’t even know her, but they don’t like anyone that espouses that particular ideology.A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment for this story. A representative of Warren did not respond to requests for comment.Clinton earlier this month said she thinks Warren is qualified to be vice president. I have the highest regard for Sen. Warren, she said in an interview with Politico. I think she is an incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role. I look forward to working with her on behalf of not only the campaign and her very effective critique of [Donald] Trump, but also on the issues that she and I both care about.Warren has maintained the typical stance of potential vice presidents, saying she is perfectly happy in her current job. But she has some powerful backers pushing Clinton to pick her for the vice-presidential slot, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).People close to the Clinton campaign say that while Warren might not wind up as the vice-presidential selection, Wall Street executives are dead wrong to think that it couldn’t happen.They say Warren is very high on the list of possible vice presidential candidates along with Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; and Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, among others. We are not at the point of ruling anyone in or out, a person close to the process said.Picking Warren would be risky for Clinton’s fundraising operation. The presumptive Democratic nominee hopes to raise $1.5 billion for her campaign against Trump, and Wall Street has been a big source of funding for her over the years.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton and outside groups supporting her have raised $289 million so far in the 2016 cycle. The securities and investment industry is easily Clinton’s top source of cash, donating over $28 million so far, according to the CRP.Things are so volatile now with all of the outside groups that all it can take is pissing off one billionaire on Wall Street to make it difficult, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the CRP. And you don’t run national campaigns for as many years as Clinton has without some serious support from Wall Street, they are just too much of a heavy hitter.The progressive case for Warren holds that she would immediately energize the liberal base and bring Sanders voters into the fold. And Warren backers note that the senator has been an early and enthusiastic basher of Trump and shown a knack for getting under the presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s skin.Elizabeth Warren very effectively called out Donald Trump for cheering the Wall Street collapse because it would make him money — and that moment reminded Democrats how powerful Warren’s megaphone can be, said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Whether it’s as vice president or as co-chair of the presidential transition committee, it’s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton not wanting a very large role for Elizabeth Warren at the table.But more moderate Democrats in the financial services industry argue that Sanders voters will come on board anyway and that Clinton does not need to pick Warren to help her win.We are going to win this. Trump shouldn’t be president and he isn’t going to be president, said one senior executive at a Wall Street bank who is close to Clinton. Picking Warren would indicate weakness and panic for no reason and make them look like they are running scared of Trump. There will be plenty of time to galvanize the left and get them to come out. And Warren would be a nightmare to try and manage.Another argument against putting Warren on the ticket is that she can be just as effective a surrogate while maintaining her power base in the Senate.In the current era of presidential politics, social media has allowed more people to assume the role of attack dog that was traditionally left to the vice-presidential nominee, said Jason Rosenstock, an analyst at Thorn Run Partners who covers the financial industry. Warren has shown an excellence in the platform that would allow her to help the campaign incredibly while maintaining her growing position of power in the Senate.On the economic front, some moderate Democrats and financial executives worry that having Warren as vice president would poison relationships between business and the White House from the beginning of a potential Hillary Clinton administration.These people say there is an opportunity for much better relations between business and the White House than during President Barack Obama’s tenure, as well as more effective deal making with Congress to avoid the kind of fiscal crises that damaged the economy the past six years. In addition to cutting deals on taxes and infrastructure, Wall Street worries about the return of the debt ceiling as a potentially big issue in 2016, as well as the return of sequester spending cuts.There is going to be a lot to deal with in the first 100 days, and I’m not sure going left and picking Warren would be particularly helpful, said a top financial services lobbyist in Washington.This Democrat, along with several Wall Street donors mentioned Kaine as the ideal vice-presidential pick. The Virginia Democrat comes from a key swing state, is fluent in Spanish, sits on the Armed Services Committee and is generally palatable to both progressives and more business-friendly Democrats.He checks every box, the moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry said. You could see him step in as president, he is credible with the base of the party, and he’s also comfortable spending time with the rich people you need to raise money from. If Donald Trump’s claims that certain of his commercial ventures benefit charity are untrue, he could be held liable under Section 349 of New York’s General Business Law, which forbids deceptive business acts and practices, as well as under charitable solicitation laws, according to legal experts. In promoting products as varied as Trump University, Trump Vodka, a Trump board game and his latest book, Crippled America, the businessman has declared that the proceeds would go to charity. None of Trump’s proceeds from Trump University have gone to charity, and only a few hundred dollars of charitable giving related to Trump Vodka has been accounted for. News organizations have been unable to verify his other claims, and his representatives have been unwilling to provide more information about them or even to confirm them. While lawyers say Trump could be liable in a number of states for false claims, the official most likely to take up the matter would be Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of New York, where Trump resides and is already the defendant in a consumer fraud case brought by the state over Trump University. Referring to Trump’s claims about his Crippled America book profits, a spokesman for Schneiderman’s office said that the law against deceptive business practices was a more likely avenue of pursuit than the charitable solicitation law. But he added that lawyers at the attorney general’s office had not yet decided whether to look into the matter. In recent weeks, Trump has come under fire for exaggerating the amount of money he raised for veterans at a campaign event in January and for donating much of that money only after reporters began asking questions about it. A state AG investigation of Trump’s other claims of charitable giving would keep the issue alive and burden the presumptive Republican nominee — already embroiled in a number of lawsuits — with another legal headache. At least one congressman from New York says Schneiderman should investigate Trump’s claims about Crippled America. To the extent jurisdiction exists, it seems appropriate that the attorney general should examine whether Trump’s fraudulent schemes extend to his book-promotion activity, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries told POLITICO. Neither Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, nor Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, responded to multiple requests for comment. At an October campaign stop in Iowa, Trump plugged the upcoming release of the book, saying, With everything else I’m writing books. This was the last thing. But it was a lot of money that’s going to go to charity, and frankly, I think the title is amazing. That same day, Trump’s director of social media, Dan Scavino, tweeted, Proceeds of @realDonaldTrumps book, ‘Crippled America’ (coming soon) will be going to charity. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Scavino did not respond to a request for comment.At a press conference tied to the book’s release at Trump Tower in New York last November, Trump said, The profits of my book? I’m giving them away to a lot of different people, including the vets.So far, Trump has made somewhere from $1 million to $5 million in royalties on the book, according to a personal financial disclosure filed last month with the FEC, but Hicks did not respond to repeated questions about whether any of the proceeds went to charity and no donation has been publicized. If Trump fails to follow through on the statements made by him and his employee, he could be running afoul of the law, according to James Fishman, an emeritus professor of law at Pace University with expertise in non-profit organizations. In terms of promising to give money to charities, that can be looked at as fraud if he has gotten people to contribute on that basis, Fishman said.The charity claims made their way into numerous news reports, social media posts and online reader reviews of the book. Thank You For Donating Proceeds To Vet Charities!!! reads the subject line of one review on Amazon. Proceeds to charity GREAT BOOK! proclaims another. A Facebook page set up to promote the book includes a post that reads, ’I just started reading this and it is a great book already and Im glad you are donating the proceeds to charity!’ - Joe (Unsolicited Amazon Testimonial).A Trump fan Facebook group promoted a link for pre-ordering the book this way: Trump has just went live with the ‘pre-orders’ of his brand new book, Crippled America!! Trumps campaign manager also confirmed that the proceeds for the book go directly to CHARITY! Support the cause, get educated, and help us MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Secure your copy by pre-ordering today.In general you can’t promote a book by saying the benefits will go to charity when that’s false, and that’s where general consumer protection laws would come in, said Dan Kurtz, a former assistant attorney general of New York in charge of the state’s Charities Bureau.Kurtz added that Trump might also be subject to New York’s charitable solicitation laws. Those regulations generally apply to instances where a business markets its goods as benefiting a particular charitable organization, but Kurtz said Trump’s vaguer marketing claims arguably also fall under that law as well.Kurtz said that the book’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, might be on the hook as well for claims Trump made. A spokesman for the publisher declined to comment on the record. Crippled America is not the only money-making venture that Trump has publicized as benefiting charity. He has also claimed that proceeds or profits from Trump University, Trump Vodka, The Art of the Deal and a Trump board game would benefit charity. Promoting Trump Vodka in 2006, Trump told Larry King, Im giving the money to charity. But the only apparent donation related to Trump Vodka is a few hundred dollars given to a group supporting Walter Reed Hospital in connection with a specific promotion, as reported by CNN last month.Trump marketed Trump University as a charitable venture and said he would give any money he made off of it to charity, but he has not given money from it to charity, as Time reported in November. Trump’s lawyer told Time that the New York billionaire transferred the $5 million he made from Trump University, which is embroiled in multiple fraud lawsuits, back to the business when it landed in legal trouble. Kurtz said that while older marketing claims of charitable giving, if false, might be too stale to pursue on their own, they would be relevant to more recent cases, like that of Crippled America.If somebody could demonstrate there’s a pattern, even if the claims themselves aren’t actionable, it shows the propensity to do it, he said. It reinforces the case. Bernie Sanders is on a crash course with the Congressional Black Caucus.In a letter sent to both the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, the CBC is expressing its resolute opposition to two key reforms demanded by Sanders in the run-up to the Democratic convention: abolishing the party’s superdelegate system and opening Democratic primaries up to independents and Republicans. The Democratic Members of the Congressional Black Caucus recently voted unanimously to oppose any suggestion or idea to eliminate the category of Unpledged Delegate to the Democratic National Convention (aka Super Delegates) and the creation of uniform open primaries in all states, says the letter, which was obtained by POLITICO. The Democratic Party benefits from the current system of unpledged delegates to the National Convention by virtue of rules that allow members of the House and Senate to be seated as a delegate without the burdensome necessity of competing against constituents for the honor of representing the state during the nominating process.The letter — which was also sent to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz — follows a Wednesday CBC meeting where members discussed for over an hour the impact of eliminating superdelegates on the African-American community, according to CBC Chairman Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.). We passed a resolution in our caucus that we would vehemently oppose any change in the superdelegate system because members of the CBC might want to participate in the Democratic convention as delegates but if we would have to run for the delegate slot at the county level or state level or district level, we would be running against our constituents and were not going to do that, said Butterfield. But we want to participate as delegates and thats why this superdelegates system was created in the beginning, so members would not have to run against their own constituents.The opposition to open primaries is based on the fear that allowing independent or Republican voters to participate in Democratic primaries would dilute minority voting strength in many places.The superdelegate system has been a flashpoint throughout the campaign. Sanders and his supporters have railed against the unelected superdelegates, who have the freedom to back any candidate they choose. This year, the vast majority of them have endorsed Clinton — many of them before the first votes of the primary season were even cast. In states where Sanders has won the popular vote but not the support of the state’s superdelegates, it’s led to deep resentment at the grassroots level and fueled claims that the nominating process was rigged. In Wyoming, for example, despite defeating Clinton in the states April 9 Democratic caucuses by 56 percent to 44 percent, Sanders actually suffered a net delegate loss because the state’s four superdelegates all backed Clinton.According to the Associated Press, Clinton currently has the support of 587 superdelegates to 48 for Sanders.Several state Democratic conventions in recent months considered resolutions abolishing the superdelegate system, or changing it so that superdelegates must align themselves in proportion to the outcome. The pressure to eliminate or modify the superdelegate allocation process has led some senior party leaders to express support for reform. Im very open to a reform that says the superdelegates have to vote with the preferences of their state, said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a former DNC chairman. Thats not a problem —in the same proportion.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the party’s most influential liberals and a Clinton supporter, criticized superdelegates during the Massachusetts Democratic state convention.I’m a superdelegate, and I don’t believe in superdelegates, Warren told reporters at the June 5 convention. Many African-American lawmakers, however, are loathe to give up any influence and hard-won gains in the selection of the Democratic nominee. In a letter accompanying the CBC letter to Democratic colleagues, Rep. James Clyburn — a member of House leadership and co-chairman of a 2009 commission that reviewed the Democratic nominating process — strongly pushed back against criticism of the superdelegate process.Let me be clear, our delegate selection process is not rigged, Clyburn wrote in the separate letter, also obtained by POLITICO. It is transparent to the public and open for participation for all who wish to declare themselves.The Sanders campaign declined to comment on the letters. Retaining some kind of superdelegate system has been a high priority for CBC members, said Democratic strategist Doug Thornell, formerly the group’s communications director. Sanders did a lot of things right in this campaign, he did a lot better than expected. At the same time he seemed to have a lack of understanding or lack of relationships with black leaders that you saw ultimately hurt him in South Carolina and other states with big black electorates, Thornell said. And this is something that the CBC is going to be very passionate and push back against. This is a way that African-American officials can represent their district and have a say in the process. Theyre not going to go along with this at all.Multiple CBC members conceded that the superdelegate system has its flaws, but also argued its not worth scrapping. Ive been listening to both sides, all sides of the debate and I think both sides have made persuasive arguments, said one CBC member, who asked to not be named. The superdelegate system is not perfect but it has worked for us quite well over the years and frankly the superdelegates have never needed to cast any superdelegate votes to alter what the voters did during the primary elections, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Never. Thats not the case this year either. The concern many of us have, of course, is that our numbers would shrink in terms of having influence over and involvement with what happens at the convention.Cleaver added that the CBC would not be swayed on the superdelegate issue. The black caucus is immovable on this subject because our number one concern is going to be an always be the highest level of minority participation as possible at the convention, Cleaver said. Youre going to see the same thing with the Hispanic Congressional Caucus. Mr. Sanders, if he had met with either or whats called the tri-caucus, he would have found out there is no flexibility. Donald Trump sought to clarify his positions on guns on Monday, the morning after the National Rifle Association’s top two officials said his advocacy of Second Amendment rights had gone too far — even for them.At a Friday night rally in Houston, Trump suggested that the terrorist attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub might have been avoided or least made less deadly if more people inside the club had been armed. It would have been a beautiful sight, Trump said to the raucous Texas crowd, to see armed patrons shoot the son of a bitch.But Monday morning, Trump backed away from that comment in a post to Twitter, writing that he was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.The presumptive Republican nominee’s backtracking brings him in line with the NRA after the gun-rights groups top two officials criticized Trump in separate appearances on Sunday-morning political talk shows. NRA Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said on CBS’ Face the Nation that he didn’t think we should have firearms where people are drinking. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, was sharper in his criticism of Trump’s stance. No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms, Cox said on ABC’s This Week. That defies common sense. It also defies the law. Its not what were talking about here.The NRA later tried to clarify LaPierre’s statement on Twitter, writing on his behalf that it’s fine to carry a gun in a restaurant or bar serving alcohol as long as you do not plan to drink.Its not the first split between Trump and the NRA, which endorsed him in May at its leadership forum in Louisville, Kentucky.Last week, Trump promised to meet with the NRA about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.Our position is no guns for terrorists — period, the association replied. Due process & right to self-defense for law-abiding Americans. Now that Hillary Clinton has dispatched Bernie Sanders, she’s making a big play for one of his core fan bases: young voters.The first high-profile Sanders staffer, specializing in college student outreach, decamped earlier this month from Burlington to Brooklyn, joining other battleground state aides who had worked for the Vermont senator and are now in Clinton’s camp. Advisers to both candidates say more Sanders staffers will be hired soon. Meanwhile, Clinton’s allies in the environmental, labor and women’s health communities are tapping into the same data, digital and other messaging tactics that Sanders used to such great effect in galvanizing millions of millennial supporters. And talks are ongoing between both campaigns about how to deploy Sanders later this summer and fall as a Clinton surrogate. The Clinton camp wants him to make his largest splash with the young cohort captivated by his Brooklyn-tinged talk of revolution.They’re discussing all these things now, and once they figure it out, that’s what he’ll be doing, Sanders’ senior adviser Tad Devine told POLITICO.For Clinton, moving ahead of the Democratic National Convention to start targeting young voters is a vital play to unify a part of the party base that came out in record numbers to propel Barack Obama into the White House in 2008 and then assisted with his reelection four years later.Millennials, roughly defined as someone born between the early 1980s and the closing days of the Bill Clinton presidency in 2000, are now larger in size (75.4 million, according to a Pew Research Center report from April) than the Baby Boomers (74.9 million). But they have an unproven track record when it comes to actually voting. But Clinton won’t be alone in appealing to millennials. They represent a unique pickup opportunity for the biggest wild card of 2016, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump is anything but a traditional candidate, and on issues like gay marriage, student debt and Planned Parenthood he’s said enough to muddy the partisan battle lines and come across as at least a more moderate option than many of his peers in the GOP. Of course, for all of those remarks, Trump’s rants about everyone from Mexicans to Muslims and the disabled also stand out as big turnoffs for millennials. People want candidates who are kind to people of all walks of life. That’s not really what Donald Trump exudes, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a GOP pollster and author who has written about her party’s need to appeal to millennial voters, said last week during an event co-hosted by Ad Age Magazine and Time Inc.Trump’s celebrity status prior to his presidential campaign makes him a unique cultural phenomenon for younger people who have grown up knowing him more as host of his own reality TV show. It’s one of the reasons why a Saturday Night Live parody viral video with Trump dad dancing to a song by the rapper Drake has garnered more than 7 million views on YouTube. Trump’s obsessive social media presence and the sheer size of his follower base means he will be a frequent presence for young voters via their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat apps, even for the people who don’t necessary want to see posts about him. Where he has a distinct advantage, he’ll find untraditional ways to get into their stream of life that could impact and help him at least resonate, Zac Moffatt, who worked in 2012 as digital director for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said in an interview.                            Supporters cheer as Bernie Sanders arrives at a campaign rally at Penn State University, Tuesday, April 19.  AP PhotoTrump has the Clinton campaign and its allies especially nervous because he polls well with younger men and has even come within striking distance among 18-to-29 year olds in some recent polls, including an ABC News/Washington Post survey that showed a 17-point swing toward the Republican between March and May and a Public Policy Polling survey released last week in the battleground of Virginia where Clinton’s lead shrinks to 36 percent to 28 percent when voters have the option of voting for the Libertarian and Green Party candidates. But while those data points are disconcerting for Democrats, they also aren’t seen as insurmountable either. There are other public polls showing Clinton crushing Trump in head-to-head contests, including a Harvard Institute of Politics survey from earlier this spring where she led by 36 points and a Bloomberg Politics national survey out last week where she was ahead 3 to 1 among likely voters between 18- and 29-years old.While Sanders may have netted an estimated 1.2 million more votes than Clinton among 18- to 29-year olds during the 2016 primary and caucus contests, the general election will draw in millions more young people who didn’t bother to participate in their primaries and caucuses, let alone register to vote. That means their choices will essentially boil down to a pick among Clinton, Trump or a third party candidate. Or they could decide not to turn out at all.You’re not going to spend your time on millennials who are not going to come out to vote at least in the ground game going into November in the same way a brand wouldn’t spend all of its time and resources going after someone who is only going to maybe try their product one out of five times, said Beth Lester Sidhu, the chief operating officer at the Stagwell Group, an investment firm founded by former Clinton 2008 campaign chief strategist and pollster Mark Penn.Clinton campaign aides said in interviews that they were well aware of the challenges they face just in getting young people engaged with their campaign. After all, their attempts during the primaries to connect with younger people were frequently met with online mockery, including a request for feedback about student loan debt via emoji and a quick Snapchat video of Clinton rapping next to a river in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that has since gone viral with more than 29 million views. But even as Clinton’s hipness comes under question, her aides say she’ll embrace her age – 68, which is actually two years younger than Trump -- and inner policy wonk. She doesn’t need to be cool. She just needs to be who she is, said Sarah Audelo, the Clinton campaign’s youth vote director. That’s what young people are interested in. Young people want authenticity.The Clinton youth vote gameplan includes targeting different subgroups of the millennial generation on their own turf. High school students who will be 18 by Election Day can expect to get their own special pitch. Different messages will be directed at college students, young professionals just getting started in their careers and older millennials who have started families. Clinton’s youth-vote staffers are planning to take a listening tour of college campuses and other places where millennials work and congregate. In Brooklyn, youth vote outreach is managed by Addisu Demissie, the longtime Democratic campaign consultant now working as Clinton’s national voter outreach and mobilization director. His chief lieutenants are Audelo, a former political director at the nonprofit Rock the Vote; Anne Hubert, a former Viacom senior vice president leading the millennial outreach effort; and Kunoor Ojha, the first major hire from Sanders’ campaign now running the national campus and student organizing program for Clinton in Brooklyn. Other staffers from the Vermont senator’s campaign are likely to be added in the weeks to come.I’m sure there will be more, said Ken Strasma, a longtime Democratic data and micro-targeting expert who worked for Obama in 2008 and has spearheaded the Sanders effort in 2016. Clinton also has air cover targeting the youth vote coming from several super PACs working on her behalf or taking aim at Trump. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer’s well-funded super PAC, NextGen Climate Action, hired a dozen former Sanders staffers to work on a $25 million anti-Trump campaign. The San Francisco-based group is planning voter registration efforts on some 200 college campuses in six presidential battleground states – Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania – as well as in Illinois, where there is a heated Senate race. The group also plans to target older millennials with a digital-first ad blast in several presidential swing states.Strasma’s firm, HaystaqDNA, has been in talks with the For Our Future super PAC, a group also backed by Steyer, and four labor organizations that are focusing on turning out traditional Democratic voters for Clinton in key battleground states. The pro-choice group Emily’s List has a $20 million campaign targeting young women voters involving SS+K, a New York ad firm that did similar work for Obama in 2008 and 2012.In a speech last week, Sanders said he had been surprised during the primaries by the size of his support among young voters, which he noted he won by huge numbers in many states. While still not officially endorsing Clinton or suspending his campaign, he did promise to work with the presumptive nominee to beat Trump in the general election. Several of his advisers have also started to elaborate on that game plan.                             Bernie Sanders supporters cheer as at a campaign rally on Sunday, April 17, 2016, in the Brooklyn borough of New York.  AP PhotoDevine, a longtime Democratic consultant who before working for Sanders had been a top presidential campaign aide to Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, said young people will engage and will turn out in this election particularly if they feel that there is an agenda being presented that will make a real difference in their lives. The data and targeting tools that Sanders used to great effect in the Democratic primaries, Devine added, will also be available to Clinton. We know who they are. We’ve identified them. They’re part of the process, Devine said. And the modern tools of campaigning, once you’ve identified somebody, give you the ability to contact them, to persuade them and to mobilize them like you’ve never seen before.On the stump, Clinton is expected to get a big boost from several high profile celebrities with appeal to millennials, including pop singer Katy Perry and actress Lena Dunham.Obama also is likely to return to many of the college campuses he once packed back in 2008. But it’s Sanders who many of his campaign aides expect will be a main draw.Said Strasma, He’ll be one of the strongest surrogates for Clinton among young people. PHOENIX — Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a Happy Birthday message.Did he get in touch? the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied, no, but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email. A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite I love Sheriff Joe!It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14 — but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens.Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate. They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America’s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny political correctness of minority groups. Arpaio hit on the formula first — adding a Korean War veteran’s fondness for accumulating .50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance — but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick. I don’t like people to say, ‘He’s copying you,’ Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast.As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does — but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence.During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others?Why would I bite the hand that feeds? he said, shaking his head in disapproval.In Arpaio’s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it’s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him. Im controversial, he added with a shrug. You wouldnt be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I dont think.(In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed — he had the medical bills. In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3.75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriffs real estate transactions.)(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York’s tabloids. Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being controversial was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation. Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he’s strictly a self-made madman.He’s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there’s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news. He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he’s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn’t so bad (there wasnt that much crime when the mob — now, Im not saying thats good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too. ... They will never kill a child or a cop, OK?).He knew I was Jewish, so I got this: Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security. I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people. Im not just saying that because youre Jewish.Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point. The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky, he added. I dont know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money. Actually, Im the only one that ever busted that guy. Do you know that? (I did not.)Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus. When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea — thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter — that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy.Whether it’s gays, ISIS — there’s one other [thing} that nobody is talking about. Everybody there happened to be Latino. Why? — because that was a night for Latino and Cuban, he told me. Why didn’t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn’t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn’t like it? Come on. You’re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS. What about Hispanics? Why isn’t anybody — why hasn’t the news media even asked that question?Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded. He was undeterred.It could be because there is talk around the nation — there’s a lot of people that don’t like Hispanics. Is that a secret? he added.In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics.Oh, and he expended millions in county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama’s fake birth certificate (a crusade he insists isn’t over by a long shot). That’s what got him his first give-’em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump. That’s not dead as far as I’m concerned, he told me.But beneath the bombast, there’s a whisper of a showman’s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump. It’s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician’s power is ultimately derived from the news media — and when they turn on you, look out.I’ll tell you, the day I leave, you won’t know how to pronounce my name, he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack. You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there’s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is. That’s the way it is in politics.Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man’s Donald Trump — same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio’s life story he’s the poor (or at last the working-class) man. His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump’s partial snub. On June 14, 1932, Arpaio’s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him. His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store. And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else’s dinner table until his father remarried.Eighty-four times … you have to look back at your life, he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career — the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the Trumpinator at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood. I never had a mother to grow up with, but that’s the way it is. ... It was a little difficult sometimes when you don’t have a mother and youre bounced from one Italian family to another.Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites. Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country — a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself.The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino — a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics. In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a Make Maricopa Great Again campaign. Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer.Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment — and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control — has the same knack. Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him, he told me. Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field. He’s running again this year and blames the Obama administration’s campaign against his policies for the drop. But local analysts noted a telling shift — support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age.Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona’s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he’d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over out of spite. He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration’s racial profiling case — he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.I think its overstated, he said. I think theres a lot of hype. Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say. We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines. So everybody has to be very careful.You dont think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point? I asked.His answer: No. No. No, I really don’t.When I pointed out that many critics had called him a racist, he waved dismissively.When they cant get you for anything else, its a famous word, ‘racist,’ he said. Do you think it bothers me? It doesnt really bother me. I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want. ... [I’m] probably one guy that really doesn’t [discriminate], you know, and I’m not going to say my best friend is black. ... No, no, no. And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican. I got all these family — but I’m not going to say that. I guess you could still have that and say you’re a racist, you know, but no. I know what I am. Come on.He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two (he’s got my underwear) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate’s claim of a silent majority that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters.Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.All these politicians afraid to go near him, he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.I think everybody is looking at their own elections. I hate to say that, Arpaio added. You know it; I know it. You want me to say it, and Im saying it. ... People have to worry about their own future, their own elections. I understand that. But Im not the type of guy that does that. I dont throw people under the bus. I know there’s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote. People are always saying, ‘Oh, you can’t win if you dont have the Hispanic vote.’He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.If theres anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it’s me, with all the heat I’m taking, right? he said. Any smart guy would do that, but I’m not a smart guy, maybe. Donald Trumps vow to resuscitate the Keystone XL oil pipeline in exchange for a share of its profits has a glaring problem: It risks running afoul of laws against government takings of private property. And even supporters of the project warn that it risks hurting relations with Canada, the nations No. 1 oil supplier.The presumptive Republican nominee has repeatedly pledged to revive the Canada-to-Texas pipeline, a long-standing cause for Republicans in Congress, but Trump has brought a twist. He wants U.S. taxpayers to get a slice of the projects revenue.I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits, Trump said May 26 before delivering an energy speech to an oil-industry audience in North Dakota. Thats how were going to make our country rich again.That proposal may mesh with Trump’s famous fondness for the art of the deal, but it’s not what GOP lawmakers called for in their multiple attempts to approve Keystone over President Barack Obamas resistance. They simply wanted to grant developer TransCanada’s permit request, without making any cash grabs, just as regulators routinely do for countless other energy projects.Trump’s plan could run into legal trouble as a taking of oil industry property, and would probably violate World Trade Organization agreements and Congress’ exclusive constitutional authority to make decisions on taxes, experts say. It has also ruffled some feathers north of the border, with Globe and Mail columnist Jeff Jones writing that the likely Republican nominee’s kooky proposal sounds uncomfortably like nationalization. In fact, why stop at oil pipelines? Jones added. Mr. Trump could demand a fatter take from natural gas lines or even restaurants and retail stores.People in the U.S. oil industry are largely shrugging off Trump’s pitch for Keystone profit-sharing, saying his overall pro-drilling agenda is preferable to Hillary Clintons energy platform. But they’re hardly rallying to the proposal.Youre not building a high-rise here and getting shaken down by the local union for a donation to the pension fund — you’re building a major pipeline through the U.S., one oil industry lobbyist said. Something like this is a deterrent on pipeline investment. It’s not taken seriously, because it’s just completely nuts.Obama rejected Keystone last year after a politically charged review that stretched on for more than six years. Trump first slammed Obama for leaning against the project in 2012, long before the president formally declared that the pipelines 700,000-plus barrels per day of new Canadian heavy oil imports would not make a meaningful contribution to our economy.But not until Trump took his presidential bid to New Hampshire did he begin talking about extracting fresh monetary concessions from TransCanada. Trump told primary voters in November that he would want the government to get 25 percent of Keystones profits.Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who has advised Trump on energy policy, defended the candidate by suggesting a scenario where I think hes onto something that could meet his goals without triggering any legal tripwires. The United States could press TransCanada to allow crude oil from North Dakota a greater share of space in the pipeline, Cramer said in an interview, which would amp up the project’s benefits for the U.S. economy. The Canadian government initially suggested that U.S. oil would make up as much as 25 percent of Keystones capacity, but domestic drillers were committed to getting only around 8 percent before Obama killed the project. (One of Trumps newer and more influential oil-industry patrons, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm, played a leading role in winning dedicated U.S. space on the pipeline.)                            Rep. Kevin Cramer says Donald Trump negotiates on simple terms at the biggest advantage to his position.  AP PhotoCramer added that Trump negotiates on simple terms at the biggest advantage to his position. On the other hand, Cramer said, Im not sure how familiar he is with the economic gains that U.S. states already stand to receive from the 1,100-mile pipeline project — benefits that TransCanada says would include tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes and a $3.4 billion infusion into the broader U.S. economy.Vincent DeVito, a partner at Bowditch & Dewey who served as assistant energy secretary under President George W. Bush, said Trumps idea is not half-baked, because negotiations to sweeten the pot, thats very common in the siting industry. But former Assistant Commerce Secretary Alan Dunn said the demand for extra concessions from the Canadian pipeline could violate a crucial principle of WTO pacts that the U.S. is a party to — a national treatment standard that commits governments to applying the same tax systems to foreign imports and domestic goods.There are just not a lot of ways to do that, to justify a differential tax treatment or regulatory treatment, without violating that national treatment obligation, said Dunn, who served as a lead negotiator on the North American Free Trade Agreement after being nominated to the Commerce post by the first Bush administration.Mark Maddox, who served as acting assistant secretary of fossil energy under George W. Bush, agreed that any arrangement adding a premium on oil coming from Canada, that speaks to NAFTA issues, trade issues.Im not certain what the path to implementing his idea is, added Maddox, who now leads the consulting firm Maddox Strategies.Then again, bumping up against trade agreements may not prove much of a deterrent to Trump, who has condemned NAFTA as a total disaster for the United States and has pledged to rip up deals that put Americans at a disadvantage.Meanwhile, TransCanada might be game for any gambit that wins approval for its long-frozen pipeline. The company responded coldly to Trump at first, telling reporters last month that the U.S. should follow a regulatory model that has been in place for decades — namely, granting appropriate permits to projects that qualify for them. But the company was more equivocal when POLITICO asked if it would nix Trumps pitch outright.One thing that we didn’t emphasize strongly enough in an initial response to Trump, TransCanada spokesman Mark Cooper said by email, is our overall encouragement that the door would be open to approval and that the presumptive nominee is encouraging reapplication. As per the details of what a reapplication would look like, we’ll wait and see when that time comes.Brian Ferguson, CEO of the top oil-sands producer Cenovus, told Canadian television network BNN last month that he expects that aides to a President Trump would explain the economic benefit to him of having more Canadian heavy oil available to U.S. refiners.But the Canadian oil and gas industrys leading trade group stayed above the fray. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers spokeswoman Chelsie Klassen referred comment on Trumps idea to TransCanada, given the hypothetical nature of any agreement between the likely presidential nominee and the company.                 I’m not being vetted. I don’t expect to be vetted, Sen. Mark Warner said.  AP PhotoSen. Mark Warner doesnt expect to be vetted as Hillary Clintons running mate — but he did push fellow Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as a potential vice presidential pick.I’m not being vetted. I don’t expect to be vetted, he said in an interview with the Virginian-Pilot. Warner did, however, say of Kaine: There’s nobody with better integrity and trustfulness ... Secretary Clinton and the country would do well by him.Kaine is frequently cited by pundits as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, but in an interview earlier this year, Virginias junior senator said he would be a senator in January, not vice president.I’m going to be sworn in again in the Senate in January … Kaine said in April. Virginia is a key swing state in the 2016 general election.                  Scene outside Philadelphias City Hall as gatherers hold a candle light vigil for those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.   M. Scott MahaskeyThe House on Thursday blocked an amendment that opponents said would have taken away critical intelligence tools just four days after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The 198-222 vote is a blow for privacy advocates who have spent years building support for the amendment, which would have barred the government from forcing companies to weaken their encryption for law enforcement. The provision passed the House twice in 2014 and 2015 by wide margins, before being stripped each time during conferences with the Senate.But Sunday’s deadly assault in Orlando, in which suspected Islamic State supporter Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, caused a drastic erosion in support for the language. Opponents cited the attack as the main reason Congress couldn’t approve the amendment.This amendment prohibits the government from searching data already in its possession collected lawfully … to determine whether Omar Mateen was in contact [with terrorists overseas], said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) during the extended debate over the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations bill.Investigators have said they’re trying to determine whether Mateen communicated with any terrorist groups at home or abroad — a task that would be made more difficult if he used encryption to shield data on his phone or computer.Privacy advocates accused Goodlatte and other detractors of using fear tactics to reduce support for what has been a widely supported House amendment for two years running.It’s unfortunate my colleagues would take advantage of that situation, said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who co-sponsored the amendment with Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). The language does not take any tools away from those that want to investigate what happened in Orlando, Massie insisted.Advocates argue that the provision merely prevents the NSA or the CIA from requiring anyone to alter their products to allow digital snooping. They say this would preserve the encryption that protects the nation’s power grid, air traffic control system and all smartphones.Our government should strengthen the technology, Lofgren said, not take advantage of it.The Massie-Lofgren amendment will make America safer, she added.But national security-focused lawmakers worry that fully encrypted devices, such as the latest iPhones, and a growing array of encrypted apps are preventing authorities from reading digital communications even when they have a lawfully issued warrant. The dispute came to the fore following December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., when the FBI took Apple to court in an attempt to force the tech giant to help the Bureau crack into an iPhone used by shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The Justice Department dropped the San Bernardino case after the FBI said an unidentified third party helped it unlock Farook’s phone, leaving the larger legal question unresolved. The Manhattan district attorney’s office alone has said it has more than 270 iPhones that it’s been unable to crack. Sunday’s deadly attack proves once again that the terror threat has not dissipated, Goodlatte said. Now is not the time to block a critical investigative tool.Thursday’s vote represents a shift in congressional priorities since former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the extent of the government’s clandestine surveillance apparatus.In the wake of those disclosures, liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans came together to press for surveillance reform. Eventually, the bipartisan coalition pushed through the USA Freedom Act, the first major rollback of the NSA’s spying authorities in a generation. The House also got the Massie-Lofgren amendment approved 293-123 in 2014 and 255-174 the next year as part of two annual spending bills.But following major terror attacks both at home — in San Bernardino and Orlando — and abroad — in Paris and Brussels — hawkish lawmakers have moved to retain or expand government surveillance authorities.Numerous hawkish lawmakers have introduced bills to either delay surveillance reforms or strengthen the government’s ability to collect data. A widely supported email privacy bill — which would require law enforcement to seek a warrant before accessing stored email — is even being held up in the Senate over an amendment that would let the FBI use national security letters to obtain email and Internet metadata.                 The U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians.  John Shinkle/POLITICOThe House of Representatives is telling the military to lower the volume. Lawmakers who have been advocating for reducing the size and cost of military bands — now a half-billion-dollar a year enterprise — won a key victory Thursday with passage of a provision that would bar funding for musical units to play at dinners, dances or social events.The provision, the handiwork of Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, would ensure funds are not spent on entertaining generals, dignitaries and elected officials, all the different type of things that have nothing to do with appropriate military ceremonies but reserved for ceremonial tasks such as funerals.Her bipartisan amendment to the fiscal 2017 defense appropriations act was approved by voice vote.From their humble origins in the American Revolution’s fife-and-drum corps, the U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands and 6,500 musicians — with some members outfitted with $11,000 flutes and $12,000 tubas. For every dollar that is spent on our bands ... to entertain at social functions, thats a dollar were not spending on national security and our troops and our families, McSally said.The band budget has drawn criticism from several lawmakers, including House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who said military bands may not be appropriate at every event.The vote marks the first successful attempt to try to scale back the overall budget for military bands. The amendment was cosponsored by New Mexico Republican Steve Pearce and Minnesota Democrat Betty McCollum, who tried herself several years ago to cap the spending on bands.McCollum in 2011 and 2012 proposed a $200 million annual spending limit on military bands, but the effort got heavy pushback inside the ranks and on Capitol Hill, who argued military musicians are a critical link between the men and women in uniform and those they protect. McSally, an Arizona Republican has made it no secret she hopes to curtail use of the musicians for entertainment purposes, and has spoken out often about how such funds could be better spent to directly support ongoing military operations.She told POLITICO that because military bands are funded through operation and maintenance accounts in each service, with this amendment, We wanted to make sure we werent looking like we were wanting to cut funding to the military personnel account.McSallys had sent a letter, urging her colleagues to back the measure, which she said will ensure military bands perform their proper duties and limit their performances to official ceremonies, honoring the fallen, and playing taps.The amendment comes on top of legislation in the Houses version of the defense authorization act passed last month that would require the Pentagon to determine whether it could ease cuts in combat units by reducing the number of musicians.The language requires the Government Accountability Office to review the cost and size of military bands. It also directs Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take an inventory of the bands and study the feasibility of combining some.It remains unclear whether the Houses decision will prevail when a final appropriations bill is hashed out with the Senate. There is likely to be significant pushback.                  The White House declined to take the debate on John McCains comments on the shooting in Orlando.  GettyThe White House said on Friday that President Barack Obama is not going to be distracted by small things like Sen. John McCain’s comments Thursday assigning blame to Obama for last weekend’s terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida.McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Capitol Hill that Obama is directly responsible for the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in which 49 people were killed early Sunday morning. The senator blamed the president’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq for the growth of the Islamic State, the militant group to which the Orlando shooter pledged allegiance during his attack.In response to those comments, White House deputy press secretary Jennifer Friedman told reporters accompanying the president to New Mexico aboard Air Force One that we’re not going to be distracted by small things. Friedman’s response was similar to one earlier this week from press secretary Josh Earnest, who said its important not to get distracted by things that are so small, when asked about insinuations from Donald Trump that Obama is sympathetic to the Islamic State.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly walked back his comments in subsequent interviews and in a statement released just hours after his initial remarks.I misspoke, the statement read. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama’s national security decisions, not the President himself.Even as he backed away from them, the Arizona senator’s comments prompted criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said the remarks sounded a lot more like Donald Trump than John McCain, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona accused McCain of losing a step after decades in office. Its difficult to imagine the old John McCain being this reckless with something so serious, said Kirkpatrick, who is running to unseat McCain from the Senate this November. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington. In a private meeting of Democrats on Wednesday, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) begged his colleagues to push a measure that might have actually prevented Sunday morning’s carnage in Orlando: an assault weapons ban.Cicilline was answering the call of President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, to keep weapons of war off the streets. But Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi nixed it. Better, she said, to focus on barring terror suspects from buying guns. That measure’s a no-brainer for Democrats, she reasoned, and easier to explain to the public. It’s not that we’re not strong enough to make the fight. It’s just that we want to win the fight, Pelosi said to her Democratic colleagues, according to sources in the room. What we are trying to do — and forget the politics — what we are trying to do is save lives. What we are trying to do is to say that the Republicans will not even go to this place which overwhelmingly the American people support.The top gun control advocates in the country share Pelosi’s strategy, as do Senate Democrats. They want to emphasize measures that have broad support — like expanding background checks — rather than trying to take America’s most popular rifle and its copy-cat semi-automatics (like the Sig Sauer MCX used in Orlando) off the shelves. Pelosi aides note, however, that she was a supporter of the 1994 assault weapons ban and has repeatedly called for its reinstatement.We work hard to try to stay out of the polarizing divisiveness that comes with this debate, said Mark Barden, who founded Sandy Hook Promise after his 7-year-old son Daniel was killed three years ago by a mentally ill young man with a Bushmaster AR-15. He doesnt believe those types of firearms have any practical application for untrained civilians, Barden said. However, we’ve identified the lack of engagement as really the No. 1 issue that is keeping this movement from moving forward. By steering around that, we feel like we can bring more people and more voices.Barden, reached on Thursday just after returning to Connecticut following a fundraiser in Washington, added, I want to get something done.Banning the AR-15 and other assault weapons just plays into the National Rifle Association’s warnings about the feds coming to take your guns, gun control advocates reason — and besides, most of the gun deaths that have become miserably routine are committed with handguns. The ban isn’t part of the Everytown for Gun Safety’s platform, said spokeswoman Lizzie Ulmer, though the Michael Bloomberg-backed group is sympathetic to the urge to bar weapons that put the mass in mass shootings. Ulmer said that background checks are the key to keeping dangerous people from using guns to hurt themselves and others.When you take a step back and look at preventing gun violence, it’s really about stopping guns from getting into the hands of these people, Ulmer said. That approach is shared by Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, both of whom stress their personal gun ownership and support for Second Amendment rights. There’s already evidence, meanwhile, that the no fly, no buy campaign is driving a wedge between the NRA and Republicans: Donald Trump, despite receiving a relatively early endorsement from the top gun rights group, drew the line with them on Twitter on Wednesday when he declared that he would meet with its leaders about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns. That prompted a rebuke from Heritage Action on Thursday, which viewed Trump as getting on board with Clinton and congressional Democrats.It took nearly 15 hours of filibustering on the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday for Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to win the promise of votes on background check and terror watch list measures — important statement votes that are widely expected to fail.Nonetheless, many Democrats say they should be pushing for more amid unprecedented unity over gun control. Gay rights groups, teachers unions, immigration advocates and even abortion rights groups have signed on to the cause of gun violence prevention after mass shootings at a gay night club’s Latin night in Orlando, a black church in Charleston, an abortion clinic in Colorado Springs and schools around the country.Cicilline is pushing for a discharge petition in the House, which would require every member to go on the record on an assault weapons ban. He’s getting back-up from the progressive movement: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has collected over 26,000 signatures in support of the discharge petition over the last 24 hours. MoveOn.org has collected more than half a million signatures calling for a ban generally.At major national moments, the lowest common denominator solutions aren’t enough, said PCCC’s Sarah Badawi in an interview Thursday.Obama on Thursday found himself once again expressing grief over another mass shooting, and made sure to talk up the dire risk of assault weapons.Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families, Obama said in Orlando after meeting with survivors and victims’ families. The shooter used a Sig Sauer MCX to kill 49 people and injure 53 others — a high-powered gun that would likely be taken off shelves under an assault weapons ban. Clinton, who highlighted guns as a key area where she was to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, has consistently advocated for an assault weapons ban on the trail. Perhaps more remarkable is her husband’s fresh call for tighter security on the AR-15 after Orlando. Its pretty clear that if youre firing … a lot of ammunition in a short amount of time with a weapon thats designed only to kill, more people will die than if youre stuck with a pistol, Bill Clinton said Tuesday. If the guy had just had a pistol in that nightclub, I dont think anybody believes he could possibly have killed 49 people.That’s in contrast to the weeks after Sandy Hook, when he said the 1994 assault weapons ban had devastated Democrats in that year’s midterms and warned his party not to overplay its hand.While Obama has talked about an assault weapons ban multiple times since the Orlando massacre last weekend, he has yet to mount a big political push for it. Polling also makes clear the higher pay-off for less aggressive measures. While support for a ban has spiked in the wake of Orlando (57 percent of respondents in a CBS poll released on Wednesday back a ban, up from 44 percent in December), almost 9-in-10 Americans support universal background checks, according to that poll, including 82 percent of gun owners. Those figures have held relatively steady since Newtown.That overwhelming support for background checks — along with studies on their effectiveness in reducing gun crime — were why researchers at the liberal Center for American Progress deemed that professional gun control advocates’ shift in focus to prevent dangerous people from accessing guns is appropriate in 2014.However, some Democrats point to strategic benefits of having a vote on assault weapons, even if it’s a lost cause — it’s easier to vote for reasonable gun restrictions if you’re drawing a line on the extreme gun grab. Sixteen Democratic senators voted against the assault weapons ban on April 17, 2013, including the current head of their campaign arm, Montana’s Jon Tester. Yet all but four of them voted in favor of proceeding with expanded background check legislation that same day. Sen. Joe Donnelly used the specter of the ban to explain his vote in favor of the background checks. History shows that Congress begins re-examining proposals that would infringe on citizens 2nd Amendment rights, like the assault weapons ban, which I oppose, only when someone who shouldnt have had guns in the first place uses them to commit mass murder, he said at the time.  When Democrats go on offense and shift the conversation about these bigger ideas, that puts more oxygen in the room to have the conversation about these more important elements, PCCC’s Badawi said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for an assault weapons ban who introduced the 2013 version, said she still feels as strongly.In light of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, I believe we have an obligation to revisit this issue, Feinstein said in a statement Tuesday, adding that she was considering re-introducing the bill and conferring with colleagues. A spokeswoman said Thursday that Feinstein had yet to make a decision.                  President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, in honor of people killed in the shooting at a gay nightclub.  GettyPresident Barack Obama on Thursday demanded that lawmakers put politics aside and move forward on the longstanding impasse over gun legislation in the wake of the latest tragedy.  Obama found himself consoling families of the victims of an Orlando, Florida, massacre that Congress had done little to prevent through legislation, even after mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado.  Today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents and they asked why does this keep happening, Obama said Thursday, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden. And they pleaded that we do more to stop the carnage. They don’t care about the politics. Neither do I. Neither does Joe. And neither should any parent out here.The president spoke for nearly 18 minutes, sharing anecdotes he heard from families and thanking first responders, medical personnel and law enforcement for their response efforts. But he also emphasized the reality of what prompted his visit.   Four days ago this community was shaken by an evil and hateful act, he said.  Indeed, Omar Mateen, a New York-born Florida resident who had pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history Sunday when he rampaged through an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others before he was shot dead by police.As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description, Obama said of the families he and Biden met with. Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives.Obama noted that the families impacted by the Orlando massacre could be any American families.In fact, they are our family. They’re part of the American family, he said. Today, the vice president and I told them on behalf of the American people that our hearts are broken, too, and that we stand with you and that we are here for you and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply.The latest terror attack reignited the debate over gun restrictions. Though Mateen had been investigated by the FBI multiple times, he was able to purchase firearms, including the long gun he used to slaughter 49 people and injure dozens more. This debate needs to change. It’s outgrown the old political stalemates, Obama said of the deadlock over guns. The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why this makes sense.While pledging that the U.S. will ultimately destroy the Islamic State and other terrorist networks with its relentlessness — by disrupting their networks, financing, fighters and propaganda — Obama acknowledged that the past two terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were homegrown and that more needs to be done to stop such events from recurring.If you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we’re gonna have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening, he said before pointing specifically to what transpired in Orlando. Now those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead. Another 53 are injured. Some are still fighting for their lives. Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.Senate Democrats launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster Wednesday to force votes on gun control legislation and expect to vote on gun measures Tuesday. But there’s little hope those votes will result in new laws that restrict assault weapons or other, more modest measures. Obama said he was pleased that the Senate would hold votes but challenged them to do the right thing. I truly hope that senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope that senators who voted ‘no’ on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart, and then I hope the House does the right thing and helps end the plague of violence that these weapons of war inflict on so many young lives, he said.He reiterated that the U.S. can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person who wants to harm others but maintained that by taking action on gun restrictions, Congress can limit the damage being done.Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora or Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally, he continued. I’ve said this before: We will not be able to stop every tragedy. We can’t wipe away hatred and evil from every heart in this world. But we can stop some tragedies. We can save some lives. We can reduce the impact of a terrorist attack if we’re smart. And if we don’t act, he warned, we will keep seeing more massacres like this because we’ll be choosing to allow them to happen. We will have said we don’t care enough to do something about it.Obama contended that Sunday’s attack wasn’t a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rather, he said, they were having fun at a place they considered to be a safe haven.Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way imaginable, Obama said. This was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community. Americans were targeted because we’re a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love. Now if we’re honest with ourselves, if in fact we wanna show the best of our humanity, then we’re all gonna have to work together at every level of government across political lines to do more to stop killers who wanna terrorize us, he added. Principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters during a gaggle en route to Orlando that Obama has had to embark on these trips with too much regularity, but emphasized that the president wanted to meet privately with the families of victims, survivors and law enforcement. He wants to make sure that those families who are going through this unimaginable pain know that the president of the United States is there with them, Schultz said. For understandable and obvious reasons, those conversations will not be in front of the cameras. This healing process is not going to happen overnight. Its not going to be a quick one. Thats all the more reason why the president wanted to be there in person. Obama exited Air Force One on Thursday afternoon alongside Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Corrine Brown, all of whom were greeted by Biden, Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Bill Nelson, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs. The White House said Obama and Biden met with law enforcement officials to thank them for their actions in responding to the attack ahead of a separate meeting with families and survivors, which pool reports indicate lasted about two hours. They also met with owners and staff of the nightclub where the carnage occurred. Donald Trump’s performance the past month — the countless controversies and continual taunts of the GOP establishment — is dramatically narrowing his options for vice president. With the Republican convention a month away and Trump approaching a critical decision on his No. 2, each week crosses more names off the list. Trump has bashed star Republican Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and ignored the advice of senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who might have brought valuable foreign policy and congressional experience to the ticket. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has ruled out the post (even as he reconsiders running for reelection), while South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst — both well-regarded GOP figures who might improve Trump’s dismal standing among women and minorities — have all but done the same. And Gov. John Kasich, who might have helped Trump in must-win Ohio and heal wounds with the party establishment, can’t even bring himself to support the presumptive nominee. It’s not going to make it easier to select a running mate, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said of Trump’s recent behavior. The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Thune himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate. There are probably some good options for him. The question is: Are there people for whom he is a good option? John Weaver, who served as the campaign strategist for Kasich’s presidential bid, was more blunt: I cant imagine a truly credible person agreeing to be his running mate, because it would be the end of his or her political career.Ironically, the presumptive nominee’s own toxicity is making the job of finding a vice presidential nominee that much easier, because the short list is so short. Multiple high-level Republican sources said it is topped by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a distant third and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also in the mix.Christie and Gingrich are both skilled communicators who could perform credibly on the convention stage and in a head-to-head debate with their Democratic counterpart in the fall. Both also bring the political experience Trump lacks. But there’s another, simpler reason why these two white men, both more representative of the Republican Party’s past than its future, have emerged as finalists: They actually want the job.Trumps campaign declined to comment. But during the primary campaign, he said that he wants a vice president who knows the Capitol and can help him pass an agenda. I want to have somebody who can deal with Congress, who gets along with Congress, who is a Washington person, he said at a town hall in April.But if he changes his mind and looks beyond the Beltway, Christie and Fallin are believed to be high on his list.Fallin was among a handful of supportive red-state governors to meet with Trump in New York this week. Shes expressed a willingness to join the ticket and could help the presumptive nominee with women, three-quarters of whom disapprove of him, according to an ABC News poll.Trump has also courted a number of Southern governors, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Should any of them be added to the ticket, though, they would do little to broaden Trump’s appeal beyond his base. None has been tested on the national stage.More centrist GOP governors, like Michigan’s Rick Snyder, whose state the campaign views as a critical piece of its electoral math puzzle, and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, have refused to even endorse Trump. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of his strongest defenders, said he’s ready if the phone rings.I’d consider it, certainly. I dont know if I could help him. He needs someone that would be an asset to the ticket who could be a great president, Sessions said. There are a lot of people better than I out there.That may be true on paper, but the options are dwindling. Christie, one of the first establishment Republicans to endorse Trump, is in his second term as New Jersey governor and just saw his approval rating fall to a record-low 26 percent last month. Gingrich, a presidential candidate himself in 2012, is a political pundit who, at 72, is unlikely to ever run for office again on his own. And 69-year-old Sessions is often critical of the congressional GOP’s priorities and would do little to soothe his colleagues worried about a President Trump.Tim Scott has also drawn some buzz as a potential pick. The first-term South Carolina senator is well respected in the chamber and would bring diversity to Trumps ticket as the sole African-American GOP senator. Scott is backing Trump, even as he called the candidates criticism of a judge with Mexican roots racially toxic.In an interview, Scott said his political staff has spoken to Trump’s campaign but that it has been weeks since he’d spoken himself to Trump. He acknowledged he’s open to a conversation about serving with Trump, but would go no further.Beyond the question of his vice president, there’s growing demand for Trump to reassure Republicans about his Cabinet, as he did last month by releasing a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. With frequent questions about how Trump would handle relationships with U.S. allies and the country’s foreign policy overall, some Republicans are clamoring for names of potential secretaries of defense and state, too.Trump would be well served to identify a list of senior statesmen that he might appoint to those positions, said one Republican senator who’s pledged to support the nominee.Plus, it would give the media and the GOP something to talk about besides the latest Trump controversy.That could divert some of the attention he’s getting now. So that might not be a bad idea, said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).But the pool of candidates for those posts might be shrinking, too. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is practically despondent over Trump these days, after visiting with the presumptive nominee and expressing hope he could jolt Washington out of its perpetual state of gridlock.Just weeks ago, Corker entertained the vice presidential speculation around him, saying he had no reason to believe he was being vetted but refusing to rule anything out. Now, he can’t bring himself to even discuss Trump.I don’t want to talk about any of that, the senator said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has called Trump unfit for the presidency and refused to endorse him, said the presumptive nominee has himself to blame for the VP dilemma. As Trump’s numbers begin to stagnate or goes backwards, people will be thinking: ‘I don’t want to join this team.’ If he has a breakthrough moment, it goes the other way. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump appears to have paid zero, or near-zero, in personal income taxes in at least two more years in the early 1990s, according to records from New Jersey’s gambling authorities reviewed by POLITICO.Trump’s avoidance of income taxes as described in the documents was not illegal but the result of significant losses his hotel and casino holdings sustained during an economic downtown.Welcome to the real estate business, Trump said in an email, responding via his spokeswoman, when asked about not paying income taxes in the early 1990s.Trump’s lifestyle didn’t suffer terribly during the era. But his creditors did force him to live within an allowance — of $450,000 per month.Trump’s taxes have become a hot-button political issue in the 2016 campaign as he has broken with historical precedent and so far refused to release any past years of tax returns that might shed light on his complex finances and charitable giving. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called the decision disqualifying and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to pressure Trump into revealing them.It’s none of your business, Trump told ABC last month when asked what tax rate he pays. You’ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.Trump has also said his recent taxes are under audit and that is why he hasn’t released them, telling the Associated Press there’s nothing to learn from them anyway.The Washington Post has previously reported that Trump paid zero in income taxes for two years, in 1978 and 1979, when he turned over his tax returns to apply for a casino license in New Jersey.The documents reviewed by POLITICO cover Trump’s tax liability in 1991 and 1993, when his hotel and casino holdings were struggling and regulators were closely monitoring his finances. Trump’s financial stability has been and continues to be of keen interest, the regulators wrote in one report, given that he had three casinos bearing his name in New Jersey.According to the documents from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Control and the Casino Control Commission, Trump had struck deals with creditors to stay afloat, and the size of his business losses were so significant that they would offset any taxes that Trump (listed by his initials DJT) would owe on the forgiven debts.A section titled Personal Income Tax Obligations of a 1995 Division of Gaming Enforcement report on the Financial Stability of Donald J. Trump said that, As of December 31, 1993, DJT had a net operating loss (NOL) carry forward of approximately [redacted]. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he may realize taxable gains. Management has represented that DJT’s NOLs will be more than sufficient to satisfy all anticipated gains.In other words, Trump’s losses were large enough to prevent him from owing taxes.A similar report in 1993 came to the same conclusion about Trump’s tax obligations in 1991. As various lenders cancel all or part of DJT’s debt, he will in all likelihood realize taxable gains. However, given the [redacted] in carryforward net operating losses (NOLS), any tax resulting should be minimal, if any.There is nothing illegal about using losses to shield oneself from paying taxes. Indeed, Trump has bragged on the trail that he has leveraged business and tax laws to maximize profits for himself over the years. Nor is it a huge surprise that Trump would not owe significant taxes during the economic slowdown of the early 1990s as his companies teetered near bankruptcy.Still, it is notable that a man living on $450,000 per month — Trump also had a massive yacht and aircraft at the time — could avoid paying income taxes.Trump’s finances were leveraged dramatically in the early 1990s, according to the documents. A separate 1991 report from the Casino Control Commission said Trump had $3.6 billion in assets but also $3.4 billion in liabilities, as of September 1990.Almost none of his holdings were liquid, with only $17.1 million in cash.Trump has left open the possibility that he will still unveil some tax returns. When the audit ends, I’m going to present them. That should be before the election. I hope it’s before the election, he said last month.Full tax returns would reveal not only how much Trump earns, but what type of deductions he uses to reduce his taxes and how much he gives to charity.Clinton has released more than three decades worth of tax returns, with the eight most recent years posted on her website.The most detailed reports on Trump’s taxes come from a 1981 report from New Jersey’s gambling commission, which detailed Trump’s income and taxes from 1975 to 1979.Trump claimed income of $76,210, $24,594, and $118,530 in 1975-77, and paid federal taxes of $18,714, $10,832, and $42,386 in those years, according to the report. In 1978 and 1979, Trump took losses of $406,379 and $3,443,560, respectively, and paid no income taxes.I think it’s kind of crazy that to try to make sense of Donald Trump’s personal financial situation and his business behavior we have to scratch around for these scraps of information when these sort of things should be in the public record, said Joseph Thorndike, director at Tax History project at Tax Analysts, which compiles candidate tax returns. I don’t think we should have to beg, infer and guess.                 Billionaire Republican megadonor Charles Koch, pictured in 2012, gave $3 million to the Freedom Partners Action Fund.  AP PhotoCharles Koch, facing questions about his commitment to political spending, late last month donated $3 million to a super PAC spending heavily to protect the Republican Senate majority, according to a Federal Election Commission report set to be filed in the coming days.The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, last month raised a total of $8.1 million, almost all of which came from Koch and just three other donors. Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron each donated $2 million, while Virginia coal investor Richard Gilliam gave $1 million, according to the FEC report, a copy of which was provided by the PAC to POLITICO.Koch’s donation marks his first significant check of the 2016 election cycle. It’s especially notable because he has increasingly expressed frustrations with the political process, and with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, in particular. The billionaire real estate showman’s stances on trade and other fiscal issues run counter to the brand of free-market conservatism espoused by Koch and his younger brother, David Koch. And the network of advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire brothers, which had initially planned to spend $889 million in the run-up to the 2016 election, has indicated it does not intend to spend money boosting Trump. That coolness to Trump, which fueled concerns on the right that the network would scale back its political spending across the board, appeared unchanged even after one of the brothers top aides, Mark Holden, met this week at the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters with Trump, his campaign manager and other officials. Sources familiar with the meeting said it was short and that no commitments were made.Officials from the Trump campaign and Freedom Partners declined to comment on the meeting.But the news of Charles Kochs donation to the PAC seems to indicate that the brothers and their allies are committed to spending big to keep the Senate in Republican hands, even if they remain on the sidelines of the presidential campaign.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, said we’re grateful for the commitment of our donors to helping us support freedom-oriented candidates and shape the conversation around our core issues.The network’s groups have reserved $30 million in advertising buys in key Senate races in August and September and have already reported spending nearly $12 million so far, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data. That includes nearly $10 million spent by Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is the only super PAC in the Koch network, on ads boosting Republican Senate candidates or opposing Democratic ones in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s grass-roots activism arm, reported spending another $1.7 million on ads, canvassing and phone banking opposing former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland’s challenge to the state’s Republican incumbent senator, Rob Portman.That puts the Koch network’s reported Senate spending at slightly less than that of the vaunted U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has disclosed spending $13.6 million boosting Republicans, and Democrats lead big-money Senate arm, Senate Majority PAC, which has reported spending $12.6 million.                  A candlelight vigil  outside Philadelphias City Hall on Monday remembers those killed and injured in the Orlando attacks.  M. Scott MahaskeyOur president was speaking to us in his grave, yet hopeful, voice, a timbre and tone he has had much practice in using. Far too much practice.He uses it when there has been a mass shooting in America. And by some counts this was his 14th time.We have to make it harder for those who want to kill Americans to get weapons of war, our president is saying.We have been working on that one for a while. But it is really not a matter of human lives lost, people lying in pools of blood, or corpses shredded by gunfire.Solving that problem would be relatively easy. The real problem is political. Which is why no gun legislation with a serious chance of passing stands before Congress.The body counts, the gore, the all-too-vivid last moments captured on a hand-held camera, mean nothing compared to the politics of gun ownership.It remains very easy to buy a semi-automatic rifle almost anywhere in America. Only seven states ban them.So the killing continues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 guns were used in 11,208 homicides. That’s a lot. That’s nearly 31 per day.Why so many? Crazy is a popular choice. Do you have to be crazy to shoot and kill 49 people in a nightclub? How about 20 small children in an elementary school? Or 12 people at a Batman movie?Were all the shooters crazy? Could be. But foreign countries have crazy people, too, and their murder rates are much, much lower than ours.Again, why? One reason is that in America we allow individuals to own weapons of mass destruction: semi-automatic firearms with large magazines.And though Congress banned them for 10 years — 1994 to 2004 — it has refused to reinstate the ban even though mass killings continue.In America, a gun is not just a gun. It is a fetish, a totem, an icon. It has an appeal that defies mere logic.Charles Bronson — and I swear I am not making up the name — is the former commissioner of agriculture and consumer services for the state of Florida.He used to be in charge of gun permits. Today, he is still against more stringent gun laws like the ones that would ban semi-automatic AR-15 military-style rifles.People use AR-15s to hunt deer, to hunt hogs, to hunt all kinds of game, Bronson told a reporter, and said it would be a shame to change the gun laws because of one person’s lawlessness.I am trying to see his point of view: One person kills 49 people and wounds 53 others, and that is nothing compared to the pleasure of executing a hog.All these arguments are familiar. Everything about mass shootings is achingly familiar: the moments of silence, the lighting of candles, the wearing of ribbons, the hourlong news specials, the flags at half-staff, the president coming down to the briefing room and then the full-scale speech like the one he will make Thursday in Orlando.These mass shootings are happening so often now that lamenting them afterwards is becoming a national ritual, Conan O’Brien said Monday. O’Brien is a late-night comic. He is also an observer of life in these United States. It is sometimes hard to observe that life and still remain a comic, and I admire him for trying.I have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think, he said, his voice growing angrier as he spoke. However, I am the father of two, and I like to believe I have a shred of common sense, and I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semi-automatic assault rifle. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life.I do not know what the answer is, but I wanted to take just a moment here tonight to agree with the rapidly growing sentiment in America that it’s time to grow up and figure this out.Time to grow up. A fine idea. And I really wish the sentiment behind it was rapidly growing. Because not everybody in America will get a chance to grow up. Some of those children we send each morning to the safety of their schools will never make it back home alive. (According to the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, Since 2013, there have been at least 188 school shootings in America, an average of nearly one a week.)On Capitol Hill on Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for a ritual moment of silence in the House chamber to commemorate those killed in Orlando.Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes stood up and walked off the floor instead. Previously, he had tweeted:I will not attend one more ‘Moment of Silence’ on the Floor. Our silence does not honor the victims, it mocks them.The Moments of Silence in the House have become an abomination. God will ask you, ‘How did you keep my children safe’? Silence.If God is an angry God, prepare to know a hell well beyond that lived day to day by the families of the butchered. I will not be silent.’And I, for one, hope he keeps talking, tweeting, speaking out and walking out.Roger Simon is POLITICOs chief political columnist.

Email us at nerdcast@politico.com.Podcast produced by Bridget Mulcahy. Math beats mouth.Donald Trump plans to defeat Hillary Clinton through blustery force of will and word — but the architect of Ted Cruz’s efficient, numbers-focused campaign thinks Trump is making a huge mistake by burning the modern electoral playbook. Jeff Roe, a burly and self-deprecating 43-year-old former baseball umpire and onetime howitzer-crew hand, estimates that the presumptive Republican nominee is costing himself from 2.5 to 5.5 percentage points nationally by refusing to invest more time, energy and cash in data, analytics and a first-rate ground operation.By any calculation those are precious points that Trump, who faces an uphill climb against Hillary Clinton on the electoral map — and has trailed the Democratic nominee in most polls — can’t afford to lose. He dumped our ass, right? He won, we lost, so lets keep everything in perspective, Roe told me during a 90-minute interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast that quickly turned into an intense tutorial in Republican campaign strategy and management — and a warning to the man who beat his boss.(Subscribe to POLITICOs Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Theres a trove of information thats done in and around politics that Trump needs to tap, said Roe, who credits Cruz’s big win in the Iowa caucuses to the campaign’s identification and targeting of precisely 9,181 voters who were undecided but had Cruz and Trump as their final choices.It’s worth, on its worst day, 2½ points, and in its best day, 5½ points, he added. So let’s just split the difference and say that Clinton’s running a great [operation]. ... He’s not right now, so that would give her ... 3½ points.In May, Trump, who has the smallest and least experienced staff of any recent presidential campaign, told The Associated Press he thought President Barack Obama’s vaunted get-out-the-vote machine was a chimera, and that Obama really won on account of his own personal popularity, Trump-style.I’ve always felt it was overrated, Trump said, using language that conjured up images of green-eyeshade clerks feeding punch cards into 1970s computers. Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.In the absence of his own operation — or even an understanding of how the increasingly sophisticated system of identifying voters through their purchases, political activities and other demographic information works — Trump is relying on the Republican National Committee’s relatively modest voter outreach department.Big, big mistake, Roe told me. I don’t know everything that he has, but I do know a couple of things, he said. It’s going to be very hard for him to just use the RNC. The RNC has got a very candidate-generic model. ... [In Iowa,] we knew voters’ names and what they cared about and how they received their information.Roe is still close to Cruz and says his boss, like Obama, gobbles political intelligence and data like a professional, with insights candidates of previous eras (and Trump is nothing if not stubbornly retro) lacked.Over the next few weeks Cruz’s team, still largely intact, will conduct an autopsy of the campaign from a data and messaging standpoint and dial-test Cruz’s greatest hits and lowest moments with voter focus groups. The goal is to figure out a path forward, which quite possibly involves a second shot at the big prize in 2020, and Roe thinks Trump, win or lose in 2016, won’t be on the ballot four years from now.If Trump wins, I can’t imagine that he’d be in a reelect, right? he asked. He’s already reached the mountain. You don’t climb Kilimanjaro twice if you’re him. Cruz, conspicuously, remains the biggest GOP name not to endorse Trump. The reason, Roe said, is partly Trump’s decision to go very personal on the senator’s family, but also a professional calculation (with overtones of sweet revenge): Despite Trump’s claim that he’ll bring new independents into the process, 2016 promises to be the same-old base election and he’ll need the hard-core conservatives Lyin’ Ted was so good at galvanizing.Is it possible Cruz won’t endorse?Gosh. Yeah. Yeah, for sure, thats possible, said Roe, adding that he’s had only sporadic contact with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, talking or texting a half-dozen times since Cruz suspended his campaign a month back. I mean, if you learn anything from The Art of the Deal, [it] is you have leverage, you have something that somebody wants. Don’t ever act like you want to make a deal until you make a deal, OK? Then he smiled and eased back in his chair. Trump told Ted, ‘I dont need his votes,’ Roe said, with relish. OK? So that’s one way to look at it. If, at some point in the campaign, he believes he needs the votes and he believes that [they’re] key to him winning, then the conservatives will have leverage, and I think thats really damn important leverage. ... [We’ll be] able to hold him accountable.He refused to say whether Trump has asked Cruz to climb on board yet.Roe says Cruz’s surprising success was the candidate’s doing and not that of his 150-person Houston-based staff. But Republicans on opposing campaigns credit Roe’s stewardship, including an intense focus on metrics found more often in Democratic campaigns, for the Texas senator’s tempered triumph. (Jeff’s pretty good. Cruz won what — nine states? — and everybody thinks he’s the Zodiac [killer], said one former opponent, referencing an online joke that dogged Cruz during the campaign.)It’s not surprising that Roe, who shares his boss’s conservative social views as well as his delight in torturing more moderate Hill Republicans, doesn’t think much of Clinton’s policy positions or her personal political skills. But he’s a fan of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 operations and thinks Trump would be wise to notice the plodding but effective ground campaign she waged against Bernie Sanders.From an Xs-and-Os [perspective]… through a nonpartisan lens, they clearly have that part of their game buttoned up, he said of Clinton’s Brooklyn-based operation, overseen by campaign manager Robbie Mook and an analytics and organizing team that includes many former Obama operatives.Theyre not crushing fundraising, but theyre raising good money. Theyre not crushing ground, but theyre doing it really smart and effective. ... [Clinton voters] have little energy, but they’re overperforming their election night numbers routinely. That tells me that they know what they’re doing on the ground.Roe, who came up in the sharp-elbowed world of Missouri politics and has been known for his own stiletto tactics, offered a few lacerating comments about both major party candidates and their stratospheric disapproval ratings. The irony, he said with a chuckle, is that these people found the only person in the other party they could beat.Even though he dismisses the complaint that Cruz, who buddied up to Trump in early debates, waited too long to pounce, he acknowledges that the crowded field denied the Texas senator the chance to go one-on-one with the reality star.And he thinks that’s the key to beating him.Trump won, in part, because the pack was divided and because Cruz failed to move Marco Rubio and John Kasich aside quickly enough. Yeah, we could take him [mano a mano], yeah, no doubt, Roe told me.In a general election, Trump no longer enjoys the safety of the GOP herd. And with Sanders sliding offstage, Clinton has begun focusing her attacks exclusively on the real-estate mogul, something that didn’t happen until relatively late in the Republican primaries. Taking on Trump is smart, Roe said of her decision to hit the GOP nominee before decisively defeating Sanders in California earlier this month. It will be the thing that saves her.When Cruz finally got tough, Trump began dodging debates — and Roe predicted he’ll soon find an excuse to limit his onstage interactions with Clinton despite the widespread view that Trump’s attacks will make Clinton look weak and beatable.I dont know that theyll have one. ... I bet if they do, they only have one, he said of potential debates. Everybody’s going to bake it into the cake that she’s going to win, and he’s going to look like a fool and say the same things over and over. She will have the apparatus to have the time to prepare. Trump’s his own guy. He’ll be tired.I’m sure he’s going to do one, and he’ll call it a draw. He’ll win the Drudge poll afterwards, Roe added.                 A jury found Chaka Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering and bank fraud, among other charges.   Top House Democrats are wrestling over whether they should demand the resignation   or seek his expulsion from Congress   of Rep.  Chaka Fattah, the longtime Pennsylvania Democrat convicted Tuesday on an array of federal corruption charges. On Tuesday, a federal jury found Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and making false statements about a criminal scheme that began with Fattah's unsuccessful attempt to become mayor of Philadelphia. In the past, lawmakers found guilty of similar criminal acts resigned or were expelled by their colleagues if they didn't voluntarily leave office.  The same could happen to Fattah, although the abbreviated congressional calendar due to an election year makes it more difficult to move quickly against the veteran Democrat. In a statement released by his office, Fattah gave no sign that he was ready to step down, which would shift the burden to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and other senior Democrats to take action.  This is an extraordinarily difficult day for me and my family.  A jury has decided that based on the evidence presented to them that I am guilty of charges presented by the government, Fattah said.  Today s decision notwithstanding, it has been my privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional District for over 20 years. Fattah added: While today s outcome isn t what we had hoped, I respect our nation s judicial system.  I want to thank the people of the Second Congressional District for the honor of serving them.  Fattah, who was indicted by the Justice Department last year, had already lost the Democratic primary to state Rep.  Dwight Evans.  He is scheduled to be sentenced in October, although an appeal of his conviction is widely anticipated. Under House rules, lawmakers convicted of crimes that carry sentences of more than two years cannot vote in committee or on the floor.  That makes Fattah unable to fully participate in Congress: Bribery charges alone carry up to 20 years behind bars. But Fattah has not resigned his seat, and if he does not do so, his colleagues may be forced to expel him. Already some Republicans are publicly suggesting that if Fattah won't voluntarily leave, he should be forced out of office.  He should resign   he s been convicted,  said Rep.  Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio.   The House needs to look out for its own ethics and image.  Stivers later added:  If he won t resign, I think the House should take action  to expel him. For Democrats, it s not so easy.  Missouri Democratic Rep.  Emanuel Cleaver, a fellow Congressional Black Caucus member, said he s giving his colleague and former fraternity brother some space   at least for now. [Fattah needs time to think it over and pray about it and sit down with his family and hopefully some clergy friends and make decisions based on logic more than politics,  Cleaver said.   I m sure he is going through a lot of emotions right now.  We ought to give him time to figure out what his best next steps should be for his future and family.  Cleaver said he believed Fattah will appeal the conviction.  Asked if he should focus on that appeal rather than serving in Congress, Cleaver said,  That s what I would think  He s been convicted of seven counts.  It s devastating.  People are saying it could be 20 years. . . . Another senior black Democrat who did not wish to go on record said he thought Fattah should resign.  Democrats, after all, don t want a convicted felon in their ranks.  But they also don t want to look like they re forcing out one of their own out of office, especially if Fattah appeals. With Tuesday a travel day for lawmakers   including Pelosi   Democratic leaders were scrambling to figure out a response to Fattah's conviction.  Pelosi did not comment on the conviction, and other Democrats were reluctant to discuss it during the evening votes. Action to expel Fattah would have to be initiated by the House Ethics Committee before coming to the full House floor for a vote.  That s what happened in 2002 to the late Democratic Rep.  Jim Traficant of Ohio, who was also was convicted of federal corruption charges. If expulsion proceedings are initiated against Fattah   which would only happen if the Justice Department assured the Ethics Committee such a move would not interfere with the criminal proceedings   the trial transcript would be the key piece of evidence against him. Fattah would then be given a chance to testify on his own behalf and present evidence to defend himself, as Traficant did in 2002. House insiders suggested the Ethics Committee has not interacted with DOJ yet over the Fattah matter.  In August 2015, Ethics convened an investigative subcommittee to look into the allegations against Fattah but deferred action due to DOJ's ongoing criminal probe. House Ethics Committee Chairman Charlie Dent (R), who is also from Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the Fattah case.

In August 2015, Ethics convened an investigative subcommittee to look into the allegations against Fattah but deferred action due to DOJ's ongoing criminal probe. House Ethics Committee Chairman Charlie Dent (R), who is also from Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the Fattah case.                  Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn and Xavier Becerra take questions during a news conference at the Capitol on May 11.   House Democrats are trying to force a vote on several gun control measures, but are being shut down by the GOP majority. For the second time in two weeks, Rep.  James Clyburn (S. C. ) sought to be recognized on the House floor Tuesday night so he could bring up two gun-related bills on expanded background checks and the so-called No fly, no buy proposal.  That measure states that anyone on the FBI's No Fly list cannot purchase a gun. But Republicans refused to allow Clyburn to move forward.  Democrats began yelling No bill, no break!   meaning they want to cancel the July congressional recess   although their outburst ended after a couple minutes. The episode shows how little power the minority has in the House of Representatives, but also points to the fact that Clyburn, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif. ) and other Democrats aren't dropping the issue any time soon. With the nation still stunned by the bloody June 12 shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead and another 53 wounded   the worst mass shooting in U. S.  history   Democrats on Capitol Hill have responded by forcing   or in the case of House Democrats, attempting to do so   votes on several gun-related bills they say have broad support with the American public. Senate Democrats, led by Sens.  Chris Murphy (Conn. ) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif. ), failed to get the support they needed to move forward on the proposals in a Monday night showdown, although more gun votes will take place in that chamber later this week. House Democrats, for their part, have no such leverage to force votes, except by putting enough political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) and other Republicans to goad them into taking action.  Clyburn, Pelosi and other Democrats hope the theatrics on the House floor   a respected senior Democratic lawmaker seeking recognition only to be ignored by Republicans   highlights GOP intransigence on the issue. Pelosi has been strongly pushing the No fly, no buy provision, pointing to the fact that it has broad public support in polls.  The California Democrat is now employing a No bill, no break line to urge Ryan to postpone the July 15 recess unless the House passes the No fly, no buy bill. Every day, there is going to be more and more pressure on Ryan to give us a vote, or send us home without a vote, said Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ), who is in charge of messaging for House Democrats.  So far, they're dug in, so we're going to use every strategy and tactic we have to either punish them from being dug in or help them pick their feet off the ground. While some progressive Democrats want their leadership to advocate a vote on assault weapons ban, Pelosi and other top Democrats argue that there is not sufficient backing to do that at this time.

All of the money she is raising is blood money,  Donald Trump said Tuesday.    AP PhotoDonald Trump says there s a specific type of funding supporting Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign:  Blood money.   The presumptive Republican nominee suggested that he is in strong financial shape to secure the presidency in an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell set to air Wednesday morning, while criticizing the former secretary of state s campaign contributions.   She has $42 million in the bank, you've got a million in the bank.  How do you run a ground campaign?  O Donnell asked Trump about the discrepancy between the two presumptive nominees' campaign funding. Trump asserted that Clinton s campaign money was raised over a short period of time.   It only took into account one day,  he said.  Pressed further, the Manhattan billionaire defended his own campaign finance strategy, which has primarily been absent of robust fundraising efforts.   You know when she raises this money, every time she raises this money, she is making deals.  Saying:  Can I be the ambassador to this? Can I do that? Make sure my business is being taken care of.   I mean, gimme a break   all of the money she is raising is blood money,  he said, adding that Clinton has accepted  tremendous amounts  of money from Wall Street, a criticism that has dogged her throughout her candidacy.  Trump also criticized Clinton s foreign policy while serving as President Barack Obama's secretary of state.   What China did to this country it was pillage.  They pillaged this country.  They did things to us, to us with trade deficits that were unbelievable and part of that comes out of the secretary of state,  he said.

It s not about Harriet Tubman, it s about keeping the picture on the $20, Steve King said, pulling out a $20 bill  and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.   AP PhotoThe House will not vote to block the inclusion of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, dodging a politically-charged vote for GOP lawmakers. Rep.  Steve King (R-Iowa) had filed an amendment to a bill funding the Treasury Department to prohibit the department from redesigning any currency to showcase the abolitionist icon, but the Rules Committee denied floor consideration of the proposal Tuesday night. It's not about Harriet Tubman, it's about keeping the picture on the $20, King said Tuesday evening, pulling a $20 bill from his pocket and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.  Y'know? Why would you want to change that? I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have. The conservative gadfly said it is racist and sexist to say a woman or person of color should be added to currency.  Here's what's really happening, this is liberal activism on the part of the president, that's trying to identify people by categories and he's divided us on the lines of groups.  . . .  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president and mine's unifying.  It says just don't change anything. The Treasury Department announced in April that it would move the image of Jackson to the back of the twenty-dollar note, replacing him with Tubman, a former slave who helped other slaves escape to freedom and served with the Union Army during the Civil War.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also announced plans to redesign $5 and $10 bills to include leaders from the women's rights and civil rights movements.  Neither Abraham Lincoln nor former Alexander Hamilton would be removed from their spots on the front of the $5 and $10 notes. King is not alone among Republicans opposed to placing the abolitionist and civil rights icon on the $20 bill.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in April that the move was pure political correctness, and recommended that an image of Tubman be placed on the $2 bill. Amendments to appropriations bills have proven troublesome to Republicans in recent weeks.  After a Democratic amendment to prohibit discrimination by federal contractors against LGBT people was added to bill funding energy and water programs, Republicans dropped their support for the measure, and it was defeated.  That kerfuffle led Speaker Paul Ryan to go back on his commitment to allow for an open amendment process and instead limit which amendments could be considered. The Rules Committee blocked consideration of the LGBT amendment, as it has in recent weeks.  The willingness of the GOP-controlled panel to stymie a fellow Republican, particularly amid conservative frustration with a limited amendment process, demonstrates the desire to avoid controversial votes in an election year. King, for his part, saw the amendment as crucial. President Obama's on his way out the door, he said.  He's going to do everything he can think of to upset this society and this civilization.

NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.  But as they left, many prominent figures indicated that Trump still hasn't sealed the deal. When eight leading Christian conservatives   including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Sealy Yates of Trump s evangelical advisory committee and Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B.  Anthony List   lined up for a news conference following a meeting with the candidate, not a single one was ready to fully endorse Trump and grant him access to their extensive networks of grass-roots activists. What they and other attendees offered instead was qualified encouragement for Trump, as many remarked that he had helped move them closer to an endorsement. That s a better take on Trump than many of the same leaders offered during the primary contests, but it still spells trouble.  At a stage of the campaign in which candidates are typically working to win over moderates and independents, the presumptive GOP nominee is still working to nail down support from one of his own party s core constituencies: Christian conservatives. On Tuesday, Trump made a full-throated appeal to religious Republicans.  Hundreds of evangelicals convened at a closed-door session at the cavernous Marriott Marquis in Times Square here for an all-day confab that featured appearances from various Trump representatives, including Ben Carson and Eric Trump, along with Trump himself. He used the meeting to paper over past differences with evangelicals, many of whom preferred Ted Cruz, Ben Carson or a host of other candidates over the eventual winner, as well as to highlight some areas of common ground, especially regarding his support for anti-abortion Supreme Court justices.  I ve been a Christian, and I love Christianity and the evangelicals have been so incredibly supportive,  Trump said in the private session, according to audio obtained by POLITICO.   Don t forget, when I ran, and all of a sudden I went to states that were highly evangelical, like as an example, South Carolina, and they said,  Well, Trump won t win this state because it s evangelical    not only did I win, I won in a landslide.   They really get me,  he continued, of evangelicals.   They understand.  And certainly, many of the die-hard conservatives here, who have no appetite for supporting Hillary Clinton, want a reason to get behind the GOP nominee.  By simply showing up, he moved closer to giving them one   but his work remains cut out for him.  I certainly liked what I saw today,  said Dr.  James Dobson, a veteran social conservative leader and previously vocal Trump critic. But despite being listed by the campaign as a member of Trump s evangelical advisory board, he said he wasn t yet prepared to endorse (endorsements weren t a requirement for joining the board).  It s early in the process, and there s plenty of time,  Dobson said, less than one month before the Republican National Convention commences.   But again, I m pleased by what I saw today.  That s about as far as I can go.  In an interview before the gathering, Perkins   a former Cruz backer   said he hoped to be able to eventually endorse Trump.   Because of the alternative, I would like to be at a point where I find that I can support him,  he said.   If I can support him, I think many other evangelical social conservatives can as well.  But it s going to be difficult because clearly there s a division right now in the evangelical ranks.  On Tuesday, Perkins said that the  conversation has begun today  and was complimentary of Trump, but said that he s still waiting to see whom Trump selects as a running mate, and how he reacts to a potentially very conservative platform at the RNC.  Is he learning in this process? I think he is,  Perkins said.   Now it s important [to see who he has around him.  In addition to giving the main address, Trump also met with about 50 of the country s most influential Christian conservative leaders, including Penny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America; Dannenfelser (who later said she would personally support backing Trump, but didn t know yet what the selection committee of her organization s political arm would do); and Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. , Nance said.  There, Trump railed against a culture of political correctness and stressed his support for defending religious liberty. There s more outreach to come.  Trump s campaign on Tuesday unveiled a list of more than two dozen Christian leaders who are members of his evangelical advisory board, including former Rep.  Michele Bachmann, Dobson, Falwell and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Trump needs those efforts to bear fruit.  Conservative Christians are an essential part of the GOP base, and turning them out is crucial for Republicans.  While Trump did win a significant slice of evangelical voters during the primary, as he noted to the group, many of the key leaders of the movement have stayed on the sidelines, depriving Trump of core activist support and sending a signal to other evangelicals that this election may be worth skipping, even as they remain steadfastly opposed to Clinton. The real estate mogul s past more-liberal record on social issues is still of significant concern, as is his history of antagonizing various minority groups, including prisoners of war and people with disabilities.  The awkward fit was on full display Tuesday when Trump posed for a photo with the Falwells.  In tweeting the photo, Falwell Jr.  said he was excited to be introducing Trump, but many pointed out that the trio was posing in front of a framed cover of Playboy magazine. Tuesday s events more broadly were aimed at strengthening the ties between Trump and the constituency he hopes to energize. Both the format and the moderator were sympathetic to that aim.  Former Arkansas Gov.  Mike Huckabee struck a reassuring and solicitous tone as he moderated the event.  Attendees weren t looking to elect a pastor, he told Trump, who last summer said he has never asked God for forgiveness.  There was no opportunity for follow-up questions or further probing on issues. Only a handful of questions   about Israel, religious liberty and immigration   were taken, and some attendees were disappointed that time ran out before Trump could be asked about abortion, an issue on which he s switched positions several times.  There s some things I d like to talk to him about, to hear a little more from him on the specific issue of Planned Parenthood,  Nance said.   But he really didn t hurt himself today.  He did, however, stress his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, saying that a conservative court would go a long way toward protecting anti-abortion measures, religious liberty and gun rights.  Trump repeatedly painted the election as a choice between his conservative court picks and Hillary Clinton s more reliably liberal ones.                             Clergy leaders demonstrate on June 21 in New York where Donald Trump is scheduled to meet evangelical clergy.    AP Photo These will be Supreme Court justices that will be intellects, that will be talented men in what they do   and women   and also be pro-life,  he said, noting that in addition to the list of possible Supreme Court justices he has already released, he might have four or five names to add to the list down the road.  This next president   could have five justices in the Supreme Court,  he said.   Probably three, very possibly four, it could even be five.  If Hillary Clinton gets in, we know what she s going to put in there, we know what s going to happen.    We re going to end up being Venezuela, if she gets in, for a lot of different reasons.  Ultimately, the attendees  opposition to Clinton may be Trump s best hope for pulling their enthusiastic support, and he played to that anger Tuesday when he questioned Clinton s faith and suggested she would be problematic for religious Christians. But Reed, of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said that Trump gave attendees reason to be actively excited about him as well.  I think he had a good day,  he told reporters from POLITICO and National Review, going on to add,  He showed up.  He came to a meeting of over a thousand Christian leaders and spent hours hearing their concerns, receiving their wisdom and their counsel, and answering their questions.  And the second thing is, he made it very clear on matters of life, religious freedom, support for Israel, he stands with them.  Trump also suggested that he believes Christianity is under attack, a view shared by many in the room.  I ve talked about a temporary ban on Muslims, until we find out what s going on,  he said.   I was met with   everything.  Some people thought, great, some people didn t think so great.  If I said something about Christianity, it would be a whole different ballgame.  We can t let that happen, folks.  After Trump effectively clinched the nomination in May, many evangelical leaders grappled both with whether to endorse him, and, if they reached that point, whether to activate their extensive grass-roots networks on his behalf.  It was a question several top leaders in attendance were still pondering Tuesday as they left.  The choice isn t between supporting him and Hillary,  Nance said.   It s between supporting him, turning out the people they influence, or doing nothing.  She remains undecided as to her next step, as does Perkins. For Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative activist, it s an easier call.  Bauer, who was supporting Cruz, said he had to decided both to back Trump and to use his political organization to assist the presumptive GOP nominee.  He is planning a more formal endorsement in the coming weeks.  Look, it s a binary decision,  he said, going on to add.   We ll definitely be promoting the ideas that we agree with that he s standing for.  Outside the Marriott, a lone figure in a blue suit stood waging his own personal protest. Eric Teetsel, a Christian activist who ran religious outreach for Marco Rubio, stood by himself with a sign.   Torture is not pro-life,  his sign read.   Racism is not pro-life.  Misogyny is not pro-life.  Murdering the children of terrorists is not pro-life.   I may be standing here by myself, but I know I m not alone,  Teetsel said, going on to add,  There are millions of Christians who look at the candidates in this race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and say,  I can t vote for either of them in good conscience.   And they are wondering what to do.   NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.

It s between supporting him, turning out the people they influence, or doing nothing.  She remains undecided as to her next step, as does Perkins. For Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative activist, it s an easier call.  Bauer, who was supporting Cruz, said he had to decided both to back Trump and to use his political organization to assist the presumptive GOP nominee.  He is planning a more formal endorsement in the coming weeks.  Look, it s a binary decision,  he said, going on to add.   We ll definitely be promoting the ideas that we agree with that he s standing for.  Outside the Marriott, a lone figure in a blue suit stood waging his own personal protest. Eric Teetsel, a Christian activist who ran religious outreach for Marco Rubio, stood by himself with a sign.   Torture is not pro-life,  his sign read.   Racism is not pro-life.  Misogyny is not pro-life.  Murdering the children of terrorists is not pro-life.   I may be standing here by myself, but I know I m not alone,  Teetsel said, going on to add,  There are millions of Christians who look at the candidates in this race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and say,  I can t vote for either of them in good conscience.   And they are wondering what to do.   COLUMBUS, Ohio   In presidential politics, the spoils go to the candidates who define their opponents first.  That s why Hillary Clinton's effort to define Donald Trump is now in overdrive. Taking dead aim at her Republican rival for the second time this month in a policy speech, the presumptive Democratic nominee swung hard at Trump s economic record on Tuesday afternoon while some of her highest-profile surrogates ratcheted up their own attacks in stereo.  The timing was as notable as the forcefulness of her criticism: It came while Trump was plainly reeling from a series of self-imposed campaign mishaps.  Clinton s assault came just hours after Trump disclosed that he had far less cash on hand than any other modern presidential campaign to this point, and one day after he fired his controversial campaign manager.  It will be capped by an even broader attempt to lock in her advantage: a still-growing series of ad buys adding up to at least $50 million from the campaign and super PAC, designed to blanket battleground state airwaves for weeks before Trump can afford a response.  There s a natural window to communicate in late spring before people tune out for the summer, and presidential [campaigns have to lay their message groundwork in that limited time,  said David Cohen, a leading member of Barack Obama s field team in 2008.   But there s a confluence of events that heighten the opportunity for the Clinton camp: Trump squandered his moment right after he clinched [the GOP nomination, the party is in turmoil so he s seriously lacking allies, he s got no general election message and can t seem to even do message basics, organizationally he s months behind in building battleground state infrastructure, and the latest finance reports are devastating.   Meanwhile,  Cohen noted,  the Clinton team has spent a year building infrastructure to capture every opportunity.  They were already going to start pushing their general election message at this point, but now they re able to really press their advantage aggressively. Flanked on Tuesday by blue banners trumpeting her new Stronger Together campaign slogan, Clinton drew a direct parallel to the early June address in San Diego when she ripped into Trump s fitness to be commander in chief.   A few weeks ago, I said his foreign policy proposals and reckless statements represent a danger to our national security.  But you might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman he would be better prepared to handle the economy,  she said.   Well, it turns out he s dangerous there, too,  she continued, insisting that her Trump critique went beyond typical partisan concerns with Republicans  economics.   Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  Clinton later alluded to a Monday report from Moody s Analytics that predicted a recession if Trump s economic proposals were enacted while laying into his own business record:  He s written a lot of books about business.  They all seem to end at Chapter 11.  Go figure. Deep into the speech, she dove into Trump s refusal to disclose his tax returns, speculating that he s either not as wealthy as he says he is, that he's giving less to charity than he says, or that he s not paying any taxes at all   a line of reasoning that directly echoed a video published by Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren, the liberal hero and newly minted Clinton endorser, for MoveOn. org just hours earlier.   It is hard to talk about Donald Trump,  Warren said in the video, shortly before sending her first fundraising email for Clinton s camp.   Between his ignorance, his racism, his sexism, his lies, it is actually hard to know where to start.  The Wall Street antagonist, frequently mentioned as a vice presidential contender, represented just one plank of the Clinton surrogates  attacks on Trump s economic platform.  Helping introduce Clinton on Tuesday in Columbus, former Ohio Democratic Gov.  Ted Strickland, currently a Senate candidate, said Trump  is not qualified to lead a parade.  Back in Washington another Ohioan   Sen.  Sherrod Brown, also on the vice presidential watchlist   unleashed an unexpected Trump broadside of his own, inveighing against him at a Federal Reserve hearing as a  factory of bad ideas.     If your own very good brain is your top consultant, I suppose the unanimous opinion of a diverse group of economists does not count for much,  Brown said of Trump s wish to return to the gold standard.   For those of us in the evidence-based world, the prospect of this nominee trading imagined for real authority gives added significance to what we do in Congress.  The partywide anti-Trump barrage, coming after a weekend-long show of organizing force as the Clinton campaign sought to register and mobilize voters in the swing states   contrasting with Trump s much smaller field program   was met with an uncharacteristically regimented response from Trump. The Republican not only sent out his first wide-circulation small-dollar fundraising email and rescheduled a long-anticipated anti-Clinton speech for Wednesday, but he also inaugurated his campaign s rapid-response operation, unleashing a flurry of emails and coordinated tweets during Clinton s speech like he never has before.  For Trump, the fight was on friendly terrain   on the economic issue, he frequently leads or ties Clinton in nationwide polling.  But for the Clinton campaign, it was an opportunity to try to push his negative ratings as high as possible before he fully professionalizes his communications team, as some expect him to do now under a new campaign leader. Sentiment  is definitely shifting, and it s going to take time, it s going to take the commercials, her doing the grass-top messaging, and the surrogates going out into labor union halls and other places to really try to get the message out at different levels,  said Rep.  Tim Ryan of Ohio, a Clinton supporter who s campaigned with her in the swing state.  When you peel the onion back, he s not for them, and that s what s getting out.  He s going to have a rough time wiggling out of that.  COLUMBUS, Ohio   In presidential politics, the spoils go to the candidates who define their opponents first.

Donald Trump launched a new allegation at Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, accusing her of having laundered money through a for-profit university while she was secretary of state. In a rapid-response email blast sent during Clinton s speech attacking Trump s economic proposals, the billionaire s campaign accused the former secretary of state of funneling government money to Laureate Education, a for-profit chain of universities that employed Bill Clinton as honorary chancellor until April 2015. The former president made $16. 5 million over his five years in that position while his wife added Laureate to the State Department Global Partnership.  Trump alleges the Department of State awarded $55. 2 million in grants to Laureate, an accusation that is not quite accurate since there is no indication that State Department money flowed directly to the for-profit education chain.  According to Bloomberg, the $55. 2 million in State Department and USAID grant money actually went to the International Youth Foundation, a non-profit group headed by Laurate Education Chairman Douglas Becker. That same Bloomberg investigation showed that the IYF received $9 million in State Department grants in 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate.  The number jumped to $15. 1 million in 2010, Bill Clinton's first year with Laureate, and ballooned to $25. 5 million in grants in 2012.  This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle,  Trump s email read.   Laureate made money by racking up student debt on vulnerable students.  Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by pointing to IYF's history of working with the State Department and USAID that dates back to the George W.  Bush administration. This is yet another false allegation from Donald Trump, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.  The International Youth Foundation was funded by the Bush administration, well before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.  In fact, the non-profit's USAID funding actually went down in the year that she arrived at the State Department, not up. International Youth Foundation CEO and President Bill Reese dismissed as  totally erroneous  and  ridiculous  the suggestion by Trump or anybody else that the foundation had been the beneficiary of political quid-pro-quo.  He said all of the foundation s grants have been won competitively and that the non-profit goes through rigorous, government-mandated audit processes that would have caught any money being steered from IYF back to Laureate.  If there was government money going back to a private company, let alone a board member s company, my God it would all have to be reported,  Reese said.   Or we d be in violation of OMB regulations, of IRS regulations, of normal auditing practice by non-profits.  It s just, it s crazy.  Reese said the uptick in government money beginning in 2010 came from grants awarded during both the Obama and Bush administrations that paid out over the course of several years and had no correlation to Bill Clinton s position with Laureate. Reese also conceded that Becker does sit on the IYF s board of directors but said the Laureate chairman is just one of many high-profile board members, including the CEO and President of Hilton Worldwide and a former Senior Vice President of Saudi Arabia s national oil and gas company, Saudi Aramco.   It would be laughable,  Reese said of Trump s accusation.   But it s no laughing matter to be accused of things that of course have no factual basis.  While Trump s specific allegation of money laundering is new, accusations of an improper relationship between the Clintons, State Department, and Laureate are not.  The connections between the three were originally published in the 2015 book  Clinton Cash  by Peter Schweizer and reported on by Bloomberg and Inside Higher Education.  At the time, Laureate denied the accusations, and said that IYF was an independent non-profit organization; not an affiliate of Laureate. Trump contrasted Clinton s troubled ties to Laureate Education with his own Trump University, where the email said the candidate  has created an incredible learning experience for students.   Like Trump University, Laureate was the subject of a class-action fraud lawsuit, although that case was later dismissed.

As Hillary Clinton spoke Tuesday, Donald Trump s campaign blasted out nine rapid-response emails to counter the Democrat s narrative that he would be disastrous for the country s economy.  Trump trashed Clinton on Twitter as well but didn't use his  Crooked Hillary  nickname. However cosmetic, the changes were noteworthy just one day after the firing of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who everyone from campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump s adult children believed had impeded efforts to professionalize Trump s unconventional operation.  The rapid response emails, which included myriad statistics about the country s slow economic recovery under the Obama administration, are one indication that the campaign heard criticism about its slow response to Clinton s last speech.  They re also an indication that Manafort intends to make Trump s campaign more disciplined and professional.  And Trump family confidant Michael Cohen, a top executive in Trump s corporation, said the candidate s three adult children   who, along with son-in-law Jared Kushner, were all involved in Lewandowski s firing   would be taking on greater roles both inside the operation and as surrogates for the candidate himself.  They re all incredibly bright, well-spoken and articulate advocates for their father, especially in dispelling some of the false reporting against Mr.  Trump by the liberal mainstream media,  Cohen said. But many Republicans, both supporters and skeptics of Trump s campaign, note that the consolidation of power by Manafort and the children does not guarantee any change in the candidate himself, whose undisciplined past few weeks   from his racially tinged criticism of a federal judge to his off-key, self-congratulatory response to the Orlando terrorist attack   have discouraged donors and leery Republicans who d still been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. In a news release Tuesday night, Trump's campaign confirmed that it has beefed up its communications staff while formally announcing several hires, including a national political director and a director of surrogates, made in recent weeks.  But the campaign also rolled out a new website using the very phrase he avoided in his tweets, lyingcrookedhillary. com.  The site isn't live yet. On Wednesday, Trump is set to give a speech that will seek to outline his argument against Clinton, who made her first, focused speech criticizing him nearly a month ago.  Seven weeks after securing the GOP nomination, Trump has struggled to fully pivot into general election mode.  Many observers both inside and outside the campaign will be watching for signs that Trump has reined in his shoot-from-the-hip excesses. Trump s children have long blamed Lewandowski and his  let Trump be Trump  strategy for their father s recent struggles   and for driving a wedge between Trump and advisers who dared suggest the candidate who ran roughshod over 16 GOP primary challengers needs to adjust his approach for the general election. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Kushner, whose influence has grown in recent months, had been trying to convince nervous, more mainstream Republicans that Trump was just doing what he had to do to win the primary and that a pivot was imminent.   They told people he inherently understood the tone and temperament required of a general election and that the real Trump was sophisticated, charming, successful   a dealmaker who would be able to cut the deal,  one high-level GOP source said.  But in the last six weeks, the best dealmaker of all time can't close the deal with his own party, and it s based on his temperament.  It's not issues, it's that people think he's mentally unfit to be president.  Manafort is working to build out the communications staff, a venture Lewandowski had repeatedly blocked. Beyond messaging, Trump has yet to spend significant time campaigning in swing states, traveling last week to deeply red states like Texas in order to play catch-up on the fundraising front.  On Tuesday, he continued his outreach to a core Republican constituency, meeting with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower in another effort to unify a fractured conservative coalition.  None of the eight organizers of the meeting was willing to officially endorse Trump afterward. Nor does this week s campaign shakeup obscure Trump s staggering financial disadvantage or the Republican Party s attempts to paint a more positive picture of the reality that its presumptive presidential nominee has less cash on hand than many congressional candidates. Sean Spicer, the RNC communications director, said it s silly to compare Trump s $1. 3 million cash-on-hand total to Clinton s $42. 5 million sum because the billionaire has self-financed much of his campaign to date.   If he wanted to get that number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it s up.  Trump himself vowed Tuesday to match any soft money contributions made over the following 48 hours up to $2 million, another effort to portray the situation as far from bleak but one that could backfire should donors believe that the campaign s finances are in good shape.  Part of the problem is he keeps saying,  I m gonna put that kind of money in,  which makes it very difficult for donors and   and someone like myself to try and raise money for him in a super PAC,  Ed Rollins, who formed a pro-Trump super PAC that has failed to gain traction, said Tuesday during an appearance on Fox Business Network.   People say 'Well, he says he can buy it himself.  Let him put the money in.   In the month since he became the presumptive GOP nominee, Trump raised just $3. 1 million; by comparison, Mitt Romney raised more than $23 million in the month after he clinched the nomination in 2012.  Of the $6. 7 million Trump s campaign has spent, roughly 20 percent (CNN says 17 percent) has gone to Trump-owned businesses.  Continuing to rely almost completely on his large media presence, Trump has spent almost nothing to date on data programs, television advertising and direct mail.  Trump and the RNC are holding a joint fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday night, but only a fraction of the money raised will go to his campaign. Two things are giving donors hesitation: that he's not doing well now, and that he's rich and can self-fund, said Charlie Black, an experienced GOP operative in Washington and Manafort s former partner.  And they haven't had a professional fundraising operation so far.  But he's cleared the deck of the divided leadership, and now [Manafort has the clear path to go and professionalize it.  He's got to make a bunch of phone calls, and he's got to staff up, said Austin Barbour, who served as a national finance chair for Romney's 2012 campaign.  Talking isn't going to get him there, he's got to do it.  And he's the tip of the spear when it comes to helping Republicans with the down-ballot campaigns. Just weeks ahead of the convention in Cleveland, Trump s woes have only added to Republicans  concerns about his candidacy and the negative impact he could have on down-ballot races.  And the presumptive nominee has yet to completely quiet chatter about the party s nuclear option: changing RNC rules a week ahead of the convention in order to unbind the delegates on a first ballot to allow them to nominate someone other than Trump. Gov.  Scott Walker, the former candidate who has hinted he d be open to receiving the nomination in such a circumstance, said Tuesday the delegates  should be able to vote the way they see fit.

He's got to make a bunch of phone calls, and he's got to staff up, said Austin Barbour, who served as a national finance chair for Romney's 2012 campaign.  Talking isn't going to get him there, he's got to do it.  And he's the tip of the spear when it comes to helping Republicans with the down-ballot campaigns. Just weeks ahead of the convention in Cleveland, Trump s woes have only added to Republicans  concerns about his candidacy and the negative impact he could have on down-ballot races.  And the presumptive nominee has yet to completely quiet chatter about the party s nuclear option: changing RNC rules a week ahead of the convention in order to unbind the delegates on a first ballot to allow them to nominate someone other than Trump. Gov.  Scott Walker, the former candidate who has hinted he d be open to receiving the nomination in such a circumstance, said Tuesday the delegates  should be able to vote the way they see fit.  Ken Vogel contributed to this report.   They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race, said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank, said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was almost so low that it's not even comprehendable.  After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading THE FIRST ONE.  Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort, said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.  By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.  I was very involved in Mitt Romney's fundraising effort in 2008, and immediately after he got out of the primary he got his team together and he said we all need to get behind John McCain, and I ended up raising more money that year for John McCain than I did for Mitt Romney by the time the election ended, Tanenblatt said.  There wasn't that effort with regard to the Trump campaign because the Trump campaign didn't raise money on their own and didn't reach out to supporters of the other candidates like donors are accustomed.  Typically, the nominee is the one who is magnanimous and reaches out to the supporters of the other campaigns and unifies and works to unify the party.  I don't think that happened to the extent it should have. Defending his campaign's financial situation on Tuesday, Trump pointed out that he could simply reach into his own wallet if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Still, those who worked for Trump's vanquished rivals, while fretting that Clinton s war chest so dramatically eclipses Trump's, were unable to resist the temptation to knock the real estate mogul's funding strategy.  I thought he was self funding? ;), a chief strategist for one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump early in the GOP primary wrote in an email.  Several Republicans argued that it's unlikely that the GOP donor class will make a mad rush to close the money gap between Clinton and Trump, since there's still a strong distaste for Trump among some donors.  Those feelings go both ways: One Republican donor who recently met with then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recalled him suggesting that Trump strongly disliked asking major GOP donors for money. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the donors that have been loyal Republican supporters over the past few election cycles have been vilified by Trump, and he said that he could win without them and was going to self-fund, so they're not inspired to jump on board with significant donations, said Spies.  What would possibly move them to support him would be across-the-board enthusiasm about the nominee or a bandwagon effect.  I mean, if all your friends are giving, you don't want to be left out, but this number is an indication that none of your friends are giving, so why would you be the guy out front supporting Trump when nobody else is?A former bundler for Jeb Bush was even more direct about his disinterest in helping Trump.  This is a guy who lent himself $30 [million or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back.  This is a total fraud.  He's a fraud, the former Bush bundler said, referring to the fact that Trump loaned his campaign the cash and could still repay himself.  There's a universe of, I don't know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who's not going to [contribute.  So that's part of it.  And I think we're just not going to stick our necks out for that.  This isn't a situation like Ben Carson, where he's blowing through money like nobody's business.  I don't think that s blowing through tons of money.  They didn't have a huge staff to begin with.  They're not fully staffed to run a national campaign. The question now, Tanenblatt said, is what Trump does going forward in terms of picking a vice-presidential candidate and what he says in public.  That could determine whether his fundraising picks up or not.  I think that says a lot about him as a candidate,  Tanenblatt said.   That's probably the biggest decision that he's going to make in the campaign, so that will send a signal.  David Tamasi, a former fundraiser for New Jersey Gov.  Chris Christie's presidential campaign, stressed that it's still a long way until Election Day, and he said Republicans shouldn t read too much into May fundraising numbers.  It's easy to look at May and compare that to somebody who's had a 25-year start to make some sort of comparison, none of which are flattering, but I think it's an inaccurate portrayal of where things will be once things get hot, Tamasi said.

But by Tuesday, Caputo was publicly ripping Lewandowski once again.  I shouldn t have tweeted about Corey s demise, but count me as one munchkin still celebrating it,  he said Tuesday on the talk show Political Pulse.  Caputo was referencing a Monday tweet in which he said  Ding dong the witch is dead!  in a thinly veiled shot at the fired Lewandowski. Caputo resigned a few hours later, saying he had become a distraction, but that doesn't mean he's dropping his beef with Lewandowski.  I ve been in this politics game for a while and I ve never seen anything like fired Trump manager Corey Lewandowski.  I don t want to belabor the point, he s gone, and Donald Trump is far better off.  But Corey took great pleasure in antagonizing his rivals,  he added.  Caputo also said he was still  100% behind Trump  and that the change in leadership would bring  remarkable difference immediately.  Donald Trump Jr.  confirmed on Monday afternoon the family had influenced Trump s decision to fire Lewandowski, who had been working on the campaign since it launched last June.

I don t criticize them for saying what they did, because actually, it s true,  Harry Reid told reporters Tuesday.    Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev. ), are doubling down on their attacks on Republicans for failing to pass gun control legislation. It began with Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) telling the Washington Post on Monday that Republicans  have decided to sell weapons to ISIS  after his filibuster last week that lasted nearly 15 hours. Then, the Senate blocked four gun control bills Monday night along largely partisan lines, including legislation that would have banned gun sales to individuals on the terror watch list.  Following the votes, Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) echoed Murphy s comments, tweeting,  The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.  On Tuesday, Murphy and Warren received support from top Democratic leaders.  Asked if such rhetoric was responsible, Reid said that Democratic efforts would have likely stopped terrorist shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando.  I don t criticize them for saying what they did, because actually, it s true,  Reid told reporters Tuesday.  White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was unaware of Warren s tweet, but backed the general sentiment.

Valerie Jarrett speaks on a stage at the White House Summit on the United State of Women on June 14.   Valerie Jarrett is increasingly asserting control of the administration s campaign to curtail gun violence   and she s not afraid of burning White House bridges with firearm manufacturers as she does it. Even before the latest massacre in Orlando, it was Jarrett who used her influence with President Barack Obama to resurrect the push for new regulations, gun control advocates say.  But since that shooting, she s employed a more aggressive strategy than did Vice President Joe Biden, whose consensus-building efforts failed to produce new laws three years ago. Take a recent White House bid to collaborate with weapons manufactures on so-called  smart guns,  which make it impossible for anyone other than an authorized user to fire a weapon   and should be fertile ground for a relatively non-controversial compromise. But after 30 industry executives refused to show up for a meeting last Friday, Jarrett decided to mobilize nearly 200,000 supporters behind a new assault weapons ban, which industry vehemently opposes and would take a bestseller off the shelves.  While it didn t slam the door on further negotiations, it s the kind of move that would make any future talks much more difficult. With Biden dispatched in search of a cure for cancer, and Obama demanding an end to the bloodshed, Jarrett   Obama's closest friend and conscience in the West Wing   is not just focused on measures like background checks that are much easier to sell to Congress, at least compared to an assault weapons ban.  Instead, Jarrett is executing Obama s call to  politicize  the issue during his last year in office and crank up the pressure on reluctant lawmakers.  Please keep making your voices heard.  Raise them over and over and over and over and over again,  Jarrett said on Monday in an unusual conference call, which was intended for the people who signed a  We the People  petition to ban the AR-15, but was broadcast live on YouTube for anyone to listen.  I ve had people say to me,  Well I enjoy gong to the firing range and using the assault weapons,   Jarrett said.   But the pleasure derived from that compared to the horrendous damage that it can do, we believe that the damage warrants banning assault weapons.  In the wake of the Orlando massacre, which involved a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, both Obama and Biden have made clear that, as Biden put it in his written response to the AR-15 petition, assault weapons  should be banned from civilian ownership.   But Biden focused his message to Congress on passing the background check and terror watch list bills that failed in the Senate on Monday. Jarrett went further:  There s no reason why Congress could not reauthorize legislation that would call for that ban.   And stoking support for the assault weapons ban with activists will likely intensify the political fight ahead of the 2016 elections. Previously, Obama put Biden in charge of crafting the administration s response to the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shootings, and the vice president still serves a prominent role as sympathizer-in-chief.  But since his effort ran aground, gun control advocates say, it s been Jarrett who s pushed for action over the last year despite congressional gridlock.  As the months went by and ideas were discussed and priorities came and went, she was a constant source of influence in the building making sure that the process was moving forward,  said Peter Ambler, director at Americans for Responsible Solutions.  When the group s co-founders, former Rep.  Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, proposed new executive actions during a January 2015 meeting with Obama and Jarrett in Phoenix, Ambler recalled, the president turned to his senior adviser to make them happen.  He announced new directives to expand background checks a year later.   I don t think that there is an individual at the White House except for the president who can claim more responsibility for the successes of the executive actions than Valerie Jarrett,  Ambler said. Biden isn t completely out of the picture, though he's increasingly turned his attention to his  Cancer Moonshot.   As the architect of the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban and original background check bill, he s got substantial credibility with activists, especially those driven by grief.  I refuse to give up, we refuse to give up,  Biden said on Wednesday at a Washington fundraiser for Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention group founded by parents of the first-graders gunned down at the elementary school.  It took me seven years to get the first ban put in place,  said Biden, who had argued that the administration should prioritize guns even before the Newtown shooting.   We should not stop.  But as the audience waited for Biden to come to the podium, Jarrett was in the back of the room, deep in conversation, as her top aides   Paulette Aniskoff, Bess Evans and Yohannes Abraham   circulated through the crowd.  It was those aides, in Jarrett s Office of Public Engagement, who have gradually taken on the bulk of the gun portfolio over the past three years, even as they continue to collaborate with Biden s staff. The portfolio has been something of an orphan in the Obama administration, with no obvious point person, particularly after the legislation Biden was working on failed in April 2013, and Bruce Reed, who had run an exhaustive series of outreach and strategy sessions with gun control advocates in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, stepped down as Biden s chief of staff in late 2013. Jarrett brought it back into the West Wing   and out to the statehouses, advocates said, by making it a priority for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.  In May, for example, Jarrett presided over a White House strategy session on enacting local laws to expand background checks and promote gun safety technology with elected officials from 48 states. In his search for progress after Newtown, Biden and his staff famously met with, as he put it,  every possible stakeholder in this debate; 229 separate groups,  in just a few months.  They settled on expanding background checks, a measure that s hovered above 80 percent public approval since 2013.  The bill failed in the Senate then, and an updated version failed on Monday, 56 to 44. Meeting with  stakeholders  is also a raison d etre of Jarrett s office.  Part of the Valerie Jarrett portfolio is working with the many constituencies that have a stake in the issues that matter most, and one of those has become the family members of victims of shootings,  said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on gun policy. Jarrett herself is in that category: she s recounted how her grandfather was killed with his own gun when burglars broke into his office. She was trying the outreach approach before a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, when her focus was on smart guns.  The administration is working to get buy-in from police for the technology, in hopes of creating a new market; earlier this month, the Department of Justice hosted law enforcement officials to talk about how smart guns might work for their departments. Manufacturers have expressed some openness to smart guns   they could be a whole new sales category, after all   but they fear any sort of government mandate, as well as backlash from gun rights groups. So weeks before the Orlando shooting, Jarrett and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough invited executives from about 30 gun-makers to the White House.  They declined, according to an industry executive, because they perceived the invitation as  disingenuous.    Jarrett lashed out at the gun lobby in her call.  The NRA over the past seven and a half years has never been willing to come to the table and work with us,  she said.  (Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.

(Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.  Senate GOP leaders are eyeing a vote as early as Thursday on a compromise proposal to bar people with terrorist ties from purchasing firearms, which would tee up yet another floor fight over gun policy just days after the chamber rejected four measures on the issue.  The plan, written by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) and a handful of deal-making senators, is still expected to draw notable Republican opposition because of how it's drafted.  Under her bill, someone who is unable to buy a gun gets to appeal that decision only after he or she has already been denied the purchase   a deal-breaker for many GOP lawmakers. Indeed, the National Rifle Association issued a statement Tuesday afternoon dismissing the bill   effectively ensuring that a flood of GOP lawmakers will oppose it.   Keeping guns from terrorists while protecting the due process rights of law-abiding citizens are not mutually exclusive,  said Chris Cox, the executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.   Unfortunately, Senator Collins and others are focusing their efforts on unconstitutional proposals that would not have prevented the Orlando terrorist attack.  One influential Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), said he could not support Collins  bill as written due to  concerns about the lack of due process on the front end.    But I m happy to work with them so we can move this to a place where we get the largest number of people,  said Cornyn, who said the chamber will vote on the measure on Thursday.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) said the measure would get a vote, but declined to commit to a firm date.  Still, Republican leaders aren t twisting arms on the vote, allowing members to vote their conscience. Democrats and Republican leaders were mostly non-committal on the emerging bipartisan proposal, with Cornyn highlighting Second Amendment concerns and Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N. Y. ) questioning why the bill isn t broader.  The likely Democratic leader in the next Congress said the bill is a  step in the right direction,  but then highlighted why it will be so difficult for Republicans to support: He proposed calling it the  Buck the NRA  bill.  Neither McConnell nor Minority Leader Harry Reid said whether they will support the legislation. A group of Republicans looking to strike a deal and several senators up for reelection met privately Tuesday morning with McConnell, Cornyn and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune Tuesday morning.  Sens.  Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire are joining Collins in pushing the compromise, along with centrist Democratic Caucus members like Sens.  Heidi Heitkamp (D-N. D. ) and Angus King (I-Maine).  Collins, Ayotte and Flake met with GOP leaders along with Republican Sens.  Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to gauge the prospects of the legislation. I've looked at every proposal, Rubio said as he headed into the meeting Tuesday.  If there is a way to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, I'm open to it. The Collins-led bill would prevent people on the no-fly list and the Secondary Security Screening Selectee list, which prompts extra security scrutiny at airports, from buying guns with an appeals process.  People who are on the broader terrorism watch list or have been within the past five years would be able to purchase firearms without being blocked, but the FBI would be notified.   Our goal is simple and straightforward: we want to make America safer,  Collins said at a news conference announcing her compromise.   All of us are united in our desire to getting something significant done on this vital issue.   Democrats also discussed the matter at a party lunch, where Heitkamp made the pitch to her colleagues on why they should embrace the Collins compromise.  Some Senate Democrats such as Bill Nelson of Florida, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico are supporting the compromise.  For her part, Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ) said Tuesday afternoon that she wanted to meet with Collins to flesh out some provisions in the Maine senator s bill that Feinstein wanted clarified.  Clearing the 60-vote threshold may be difficult with the election just under five months away and several Senate Republicans running tough reelection bids.  Collins  measure shares many of the same features as Feinstein s bill, which garnered 47 votes in favor on Monday night.  Portman said he was evaluating the Collins  plan but did not make commitments one way or the other.  Toomey, meanwhile, issued a statement Tuesday saying he would support it.  Other Republicans urged their GOP colleagues to back the compromise   and had tough words for the gun lobby.   To my friends at the NRA, I understand your concern about denying somebody the right to buy a gun, that s a constitutional right,  said Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ), who also supports the Collins measure.   But every right, whether it s speech or buying a weapon or any other constitutional right, has boundaries on it.

POLITICO screengrabDonald Trump s campaign on Tuesday dismissed Hillary Clinton s criticisms of the real estate mogul s business record, pointing to Walt Disney and Henry Ford as success stories with similar records. Clinton forcefully attacked Trump s business record in a speech on Tuesday, questioning the billionaire s wealth, ridiculing his failed business ventures and accusing him of intentionally running up companies  debt and then defaulting.  But Trump s campaign argued that Clinton s remarks show how little the former secretary of state knows about businesses.  Taking a couple of entities and comparing that to the 500-plus that Donald Trump has been very successful in just goes to show you that Hillary Clinton has no idea what this country is about,  Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNN s Wolf Blitzer. What America is about, Pierson said, is people having ideas, fighting for their dreams and building things.  Hillary Clinton has built absolutely nothing in this country,  Pierson said.   It s Donald Trump that has created tens of thousands of jobs over the last few decades.  This is exactly why he s winning on the economy.  In her remarks at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton noted that Trump has filed for bankruptcy four times and even joked that all of the real estate mogul s books seem to end at Chapter 11.

I think historically, not just this year, delegates are and should be able to vote the way they see fit, Scott Walker said.   Wisconsin Gov.  Scott Walker said Tuesday that delegates to next month's Republican National Convention in Cleveland should  vote the way they see fit,  which could mean not necessarily supporting presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate and delegate to the convention, said he would cast his ballot in the first round for Ted Cruz, as the Texas senator won the Wisconsin primary, according to a report from The Associated Press. Referring to remarks from Paul Ryan on NBC's Meet the Press in which the speaker of the House remarked that he would not ask fellow party members to violate their conscience by supporting Trump, Walker said the Wisconsin Republican lawmaker's comments are legitimate. I think historically, not just this year, delegates are and should be able to vote the way they see fit, Walker said, according to the AP.  We'll see how things go between now and the convention as to what the next steps are.  I'm not going to speculate now only because you all know the situation may change by this afternoon, let alone between now and the convention. Walker has said he would support Trump as the presumptive nominee, but has called for him to rescind and clarify his comments regarding the judge involved in the lawsuit over Trump University.  Trump questioned Judge Gonzalo Curiel s ability to preside over the case because of his Mexican heritage.  Walker said he is still looking for clarity from Trump.

Donald Trump questioned Hillary Clinton's faith at a closed meeting.   Donald Trump questioned his Democratic opponent s Christian faith Tuesday, telling a closed meeting with top Christian leaders that  we don t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.   Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no -- there's nothing out there.  There's like nothing out there,  the presumptive Republican nominee said in a video released on Twitter by Virginia Christian conservative (and former Senate candidate) E. W.  Jackson.  It's going to be an extension of Obama but it's going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up; with Hillary you don't, and it's going to be worse,  Trump added on Tuesday. He also criticized politicians' handling of religious matters, particularly relating to Evangelicals and Christianity.  All of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes, selling the Evangelicals down the tubes.  And it's a very, very, uh, very, very bad thing that's happening, Trump said.  But Clinton has previously said she is Methodist and has talked on various occasions about her religion, including on the campaign trail.  Evangelical leader Deborah Fikes, who also announced her endorsement of Clinton on Tuesday, weighed in on Mr.  Trump's comments in a statement, saying his proposals are not just un-Christian-- they are un-American.  In my personal capacity of working with over 130 National Evangelical Alliances around the globe,  Sister Hillary  as she is often called, is embraced by many Evangelical sister churches as a trustworthy and respected political leader because she lives the Golden Rule in her private life and in her public policies, Fikes added. Katrina Pierson, spokesperson for Trump's campaign, told MSNBC that his comments were referring to the double standard, since his religion has been questioned along the campaign trail. We are talking about the Democratic party, a party that voted God out of their actual platform nationally so I think that is interesting and considering how we have people all over the globe, Christians being beheaded, and yet here in the United States, this administration, the Clinton/Obama policy of political correctness, essentially not even wanting to talk and say what's going on, that's happening to Christians all across the country, Pierson added, referencing the vote Democrats made at their 2012 convention to keep God out of their platform, which was quickly reversed.

The guilty verdict brings to a stunning end Chaka Fattah's three-decade career in Philadelphia politics.   AP PhotoLongtime Democratic Rep.  Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania was found guilty Tuesday on federal corruption charges, a stunning fall from grace for a one-time power player in the City of Brotherly Love. Fattah, 59, had been charged with bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud, and filing false statements as part of a years-long criminal scheme that even included Fattah lobbying President Barack Obama for an appointment for one of his co-conspirators.  Fattah was found guilty on all charges, as were four co-defendants. The guilty verdict brings to a stunning end Fattah s three-decade career in Philadelphia politics and is a major victory for the Justice Department and Zane David Memeger, the U. S.  attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Memeger s office prosecuted the case against Fattah, who was first elected to Congress in 1994.  Chaka Fattah Sr.  and his co-defendants betrayed the public trust and undermined our faith in government,  Memeger said.   Today s verdict makes clear that the citizens of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania expect their public officials to act with honesty and integrity, and to not sell their office for personal gain.  Hopefully, our elected officials in Philadelphia and elsewhere hear today s message loud and clear.  Fattah is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct.  4.  He could face as long as 20 years behind bars on the bribery charges alone, but it is not yet clear how much prison time prosecutors will seek.  Fattah is likely to appeal his conviction. Fattah s son, Chaka Fattah Jr. , is already in prison on bank and tax fraud charges.  He is serving a five-year sentence. In a statement released after his conviction, Fattah made no reference to resignation or leaving Congress.  This is an extraordinarily difficult day for me and my family.  A jury has decided that based on the evidence presented to them that I am guilty of charges presented by the government,  Fattah said.   Today s decision notwithstanding, it has been my privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional District for over 20 years.    While today s outcome isn t what we had hoped, I respect our nation s judicial system.  I want to thank the people of the Second Congressional District for the honor of serving them.  With Fattah giving no sign of leaving on his own, there is no formal word yet on whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California or other senior Democrats will move to oust Fattah from the Democratic Caucus or strip his committee assignments, call on him to resign or even move to expel Fattah from Congress if he doesn't step down prior to his sentencing, although that does not seem likely at this point.  Fattah's days in Congress are numbered regardless, after he lost his seat in an April primary. Under House rules, Fattah is not allowed to vote in committee or on the floor.  The House Ethics Committee has already begun its own Fattah investigation but suspended it at the request of the Justice Department. A senior Democratic aide said party leaders are unsure whether DOJ will continue to ask the Ethics Committee to hold off on its probe if Fattah appeals his conviction.  If DOJ does not, it will then be up to the Ethics Committee to decide how to move forward against Fattah, said the aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Republicans, however, note that Pelosi called on then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to force former Rep.  Michael Grimm to resign when the New York Republican pleaded guilty to felony tax evasion in December 2014. In previous cases, members who were convicted on corruption charges   such as the late Rep.  James Traficant (D-Ohio)   did not resign but were stripped of their committee seats and party membership and then kicked out of Congress. Until his indictment last July, Fattah was the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee panel that oversees funding for DOJ and other federal agencies.  Fattah stepped down from that post once charges were filed against him. Fattah and several of his co-defendants, who include former campaign and congressional aides, obtained an illegal $1 million loan for him during the 2007 mayor s race, then improperly used federal and charitable funds to help repay the debt.  Fattah and the other co-conspirators submitted false billing statements to his mayoral campaign in order to keep the loan secret. In addition, Fattah received bribes from Herbert Vederman, a former deputy mayor of Philadelphia who was an aide in Fattah s mayoral campaign.  Fattah used the money to pay personal expenses, including his taxes. In return, Fattah reportedly pushed for an ambassadorial position for Vederman or for appointment to the U. S.  Trade Commission, including hand-delivering a letter to Obama on the issue.  Fattah also hired Vederman s girlfriend in his congressional office. Vederman gave Fattah $18,000 in January 2012 so the Pennsylvania Democrat could qualify for a mortgage on a vacation home in the Poconos, the indictment stated.  The two men allegedly created a fake car sale to account for the funds, although Fattah reportedly kept the Porsche that was supposedly sold. Vederman also reportedly helped get a visa for Fattah s  live-in au pair  and gave her money for tuition. The FBI conducted a years-long investigation into Fattah s mayoral campaign and personal finances.  Fattah denounced the long-running probe as a witch hunt against him.

AP PhotoMitch McConnell is so enthusiastic about Donald Trump's nomination that he can barely speak. For the second straight week, the Senate Majority Leader refused to talk about the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, declining to touch a question about Trump's lackluster fundraising.  FEC filings show Trump has about $1. 3 million on hand, a sum that's dwarfed by Hillary Clinton's $42 million. I don't particularly want to sit here today and critique the presidential campaigns, McConnell said flatly when asked about the glaring disparity.  It's the second straight week McConnell has refused to respond to questions about Trump.  Last week he dodged when asked about Trump's insinuations that President Barack Obama might be sympathetic to ISIL.  I m not going to be commenting on the presidential candidates today,  he said a week.  Previously, McConnell has urged Trump to be a more scripted and more predictable candidate rather than attacking federal judges and talking about banning Muslims from the United States. At least McConnell isn't alone in his ban on Trump talk: His chief deputy, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas has begged off Trump talk for a couple weeks now.                   Last week he dodged when asked about Trump's insinuations that President Barack Obama might be sympathetic to ISIL.   AP PhotoMitch McConnell is so enthusiastic about Donald Trump's nomination that he can barely speak. For the second straight week, the Senate Majority Leader refused to talk about the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, declining to touch a question about Trump's lackluster fundraising.  FEC filings show Trump has about $1. 3 million on hand, a sum that's dwarfed by Hillary Clinton's $42 million. I don't particularly want to sit here today and critique the presidential campaigns, McConnell said flatly when asked about the glaring disparity.

Mark Cuban said Donald Trump has been getting stupider as the campaign progresses.   Mark Cuban stepped up his criticism of Donald Trump s campaign on Tuesday, this time attacking him personally.  You know what? It s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, but he s really working at it  You have to give him credit.  It s a difficult thing to do but he s accomplished it,  the billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner said in an interview with Extra.  Earlier on Tuesday, Cuban tweeted saying Trump  doesn t have the cash  to fund his own campaign, following a Federal Election Commission report showing his campaign had $1. 3 million compared to Hillary Clinton s $42 million at the beginning of June. Cuban also told Extra on the set of ABC's Shark Tank that the presumptive nominee had to  start learning and understanding the issues.    Donald has been at this a year but you don t look at him and say,  Wow, he s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic. ' In fact, you look at him and say,  What the hell are you talking about?',  he added. Trump, he remarked, would get kicked out of 'Shark Tank' so fast, it would make your head spin.                   Mark Cuban said Donald Trump has been getting stupider as the campaign progresses.

Donald Trump's campaign's rapid-response staffers kicked into full swing, blasting Hillary Clinton before her speech.   AP PhotoAfter more than a year as a candidate and more than a month as a presumptive nominee, Donald Trump has finally launched a rapid-response operation.  Before Hillary Clinton had even taken the stage in Columbus, Ohio, to take down Trump s economic proposals, the presumptive Republican nominee s campaign had already begun flooding the zone with a series of Facebook and Instagram posts, tweets and emails.  A Trump campaign aide with knowledge of the plans told POLITICO that the rapid-response effort is a small team, but it's growing and is actually only going to be growing from here. This is Mr.  Trump's vision and Mr.  Trump's directive being executed, the official said, adding that the team will respond in real time through TV interviews, press releases, emails and social media. Going forward, the campaign official said Trump's messages would target Clinton's policies to make the case that she is beholden to Wall Street interests, foreign governments and corporations   an argument frequently visited in the campaign's multiple coordinated messages Tuesday and all but assured to be the main subject of his Wednesday morning speech at Trump SoHo. This represents the beginning of a dramatic engagement of the American public on those issues, the Trump official said. Shortly before noon Eastern time on Tuesday, Trump s campaign blasted out an email ripping into a Moody s Analytics analysis used by Clinton to slam him by attempting to undercut the report at its source and principal author, Mark Zandi.  Pointing to Zandi s donations to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Trump s campaign shared a list of the donations.  It also shared a Fortune magazine article from last July in which Moody s admitted miscalculating its ratings of subprime mortgages, leading to last decade s recession.  Clinton, meanwhile, noted that Zandi was an adviser to 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, to support her argument that criticism of Trump has crossed the aisle.  A member of Clinton's rapid response team mocked the email pointing out Zandi s associations.  lololol to a report that came out 24 hours ago(icymi: Trump s plan kills 3. 5M jobs https://t. co/yTkTEqHzWk) https://t. co/rTFtdIFWLC  Gwen Rocco (@gwenrocco) June 21, 2016Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy, Trump tweeted, the first of several messages on Twitter posted during and after her address. Clinton assailed Trump's past statements on debt, while Trump pointed to his experience as a badge of honor.  I am 'the king of debt. ' That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country.  I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U. S. , he wrote.  Hillary Clinton s only right about one thing: I understand debt and how to handle it, Trump said in a video posted to Facebook and Instagram.  I ve made a fortune with debt.  But debt with this country has been a disaster, and Obama has piled it on, and she s been there watching.  Trump s subsequent emails sought to tie Clinton ever closer to President Barack Obama, featuring a slew of economic figures from U. S.  government bureaus showing decreases in median household income and home ownership rates and increases in the number of Americans in poverty, on food stamps and in debt under the current administration, of which the former secretary of state was a part for the first four years.  The next email ripped into Clinton for her advocacy of the Iranian nuclear deal, mentioning Boeing s agreement Tuesday to sell aircraft to IranAir, the Islamic republic s largest airline.   Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terror, would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal,  the campaign said.  As Clinton s speech got underway, Trump s team touted the Republican s economic proposals by sharing various components that earned praise during the campaign.  Then things got personal.   While Clinton claims that Mr.  Trump does not have the temperament to be President, she ignores her own lack of poise under pressure,  the Trump campaign s email read, referring to a book by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, which it said  reports on the countless examples of Clinton not having the composure to handle the rigors of the Oval Office.   The next message claimed Clinton contributed to the loss of more than one-quarter of American manufacturing jobs from 1993   her husband Bill Clinton s first year in office   through the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalizing trade relations with China.  Continuing with Bill Clinton, the campaign next sent a message alleging that as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton  laundered money  to her husband through the for-profit company Laureate Education.   This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle,  the message said.   Laureate made money by racking up student debt on vulnerable students.   And rather than shying away from the thorny issue of his own for-profit Trump University and surrounding litigation, Trump s campaign projected pride, stating,  By contrast, Mr.  Trump has created an incredible learning experience for students at Trump University, thousands of which gave rave reviews of the time spent learning key fundamentals of business tactics.   While Clinton walked offstage in Ohio s capital, Trump s rapid-response was still going strong, blasting her policies that it said  fueled the mortgage meltdown  and are  all to boost profits for her special interest donors.   Even after the speech, Trump s rapid-response machine was still firing away.   If you believe as I do, America values hard work and treats people with dignity and offering everyone the chance to live our dreams and cares for those in need, well, the formula for America s success have always been that we are stronger together,  the Trump campaign quoted Clinton as saying in its email, before stating that  [behind closed doors, Hillary Clinton uses State Department access and favors to rake in massive sums of money from some of the most oppressive regimes on planet Earth.    Treat People with Dignity?  the subject line asks.   Hillary Takes Millions from Regimes That Brutalize Women & LGBT Residents.   Trump kept up the attacks on Twitter, writing,  Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays,  before working in a reference to the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.   If you want to know about Hillary Clinton s honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens,  Trump wrote, following up,  Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State.

She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.    Just as Donald Trump shouldn t have his finger on the nuclear button, the real estate mogul shouldn t have his hands on America s economy, Hillary Clinton said Tuesday, warning that Trump would drive the U. S.  economy into a recession, default on the national debt and give the biggest tax breaks to the highest earners.  A few weeks ago, I said his foreign policy proposals and reckless statements represent a danger to our national security.  But you might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman he would be better prepared to handle the economy,  Clinton said Tuesday in a speech on the economy she delivered in Columbus, Ohio.  Well, it turns out he s dangerous there, too,  she said.   Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  Clinton said her views of Trump s economic policies aren t just the typical partisan clash.   Liberals and conservatives say Trump s ideas would be disastrous,  she said.   The Chamber of Commerce and labor unions.  Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren.  Economists on the right and the left and the center all agree: Trump would throw us back into recession.  The former secretary of state praised President Barack Obama and his leadership in shepherding the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis but stressed that a Trump administration would take America back to that time by loosening Wall Street regulations that were enacted to prevent another crisis. She also blasted the businessman for his willingness to gamble with the faith and credit of the U. S.  by suggesting he would allow America to default on its debt.  That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,  Clinton said.   Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.  You see, we pay our debts.  But she didn t stop there.  She highlighted Trump s bombastic rhetoric and gaffes on everything from claiming that wages were too high to hoping the housing market would crash to saying America couldn t default on its debt because it prints its own money.  And finally, the Trump campaign said that if worst came to worst, we could just sell off America s assets,  Clinton added.   Really? Even if we sold all of our aircraft carriers and the Statue of Liberty, even if we let some billionaire turn Yosemite into a private country club, we still wouldn't even get close.  That's how much debt he d run up.  Maybe this is what he means when he says  I love playing with debt.   Someone should tell him our nation s economy isn t a game.   Clinton slammed Trump s immigration policies, ripping his  wrong-headed and unachievable  plan to deport some 11 million undocumented immigrants as  really bad economics.   Kicking out 11 million immigrants would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and it would shrink our economy significantly,  she said.   Some economists actually argue that just this policy alone would send us into a Trump recession.  So instead of causing large-scale misery and shrinking our economy, we should pass sensible immigration reform with a path to citizenship.  She also ridiculed Trump and his  America First  policy, especially given that many of his branded products are produced overseas.  Interestingly, Trump s own products are made in a lot of countries that aren t named America: Trump Ties are made in China, Trump Suits in Mexico, Trump Furniture in Turkey, Trump Picture Frames in India, Trump Barware in Slovenia, and I could go on and on, but you get the idea,  she said.   And I d love for him to explain how all of that fits with his talk about  America First.   And she needled the reality star for refusing to disclose his tax returns, insisting that his reluctance to do so shows that he either doesn t pay his fair share in taxes, isn t as rich as he claims to be or doesn t donate as much money to charity as he says he does.  You have to ask yourself, what s he afraid of?  Clinton asked.   Whatever the reason, Americans deserve to know before you cast your votes this November.   Trump has boasted that his business acumen would make him a good president, arguing that he would do for America what he s done for his businesses.  But Clinton mocked him for that, too.  He s written a lot of books about business.  They all seem to end at Chapter 11,  Clinton said in an implicit shot at Trump s bankruptcies.   Go figure.  Clinton accused Trump of intentionally running up companies' debt and defaulting, burdening workers, small businesses and shareholders while Trump emerged unscathed.  Everything seems to be a game with him.  Well, it isn t for a lot of us, is it?  Clinton said.  Now he s trying to say he s changed   somebody s told him he needs to say that   that he s not in it for himself anymore, he s really now in it for America,  she continued.   But he s doing the exact same thing that he s been doing for years.  This is his one move: He makes over-the-top promises that if people stick with him, trust him, listen to him, put their faith in him, he ll deliver for them, he ll make them wildly successful and then everything falls apart and then people get hurt.  Clinton s speech comes on the heels of a Moody s Analytics analysis released Monday that determined that a Trump presidency would  significantly  weaken the economy, driving the U. S.  into a  lengthy  recession with nearly 3. 5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate.  Clinton sought to use that report to her advantage on Tuesday. Chief economist Mark Zandi, the lead author of the analysis, is a former John McCain adviser who donated to Clinton s primary campaign last year.  Clinton herself pointed to Zandi's Republican ties to buttress her argument that Democrats are not the only ones who have expressed alarm. Trump s rapid response team sought to discredit the report, blasting out emails to reporters calling Zandi an Obama adviser and Clinton donor.  A separate email highlighted the falling income and increased poverty and entitlement spending under the Obama administration, while another boasted that Trump s economic policies would create millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth. Another email tore into Clinton s advocacy of the Iranian nuclear deal, highlighting Boeing's agreement Tuesday to sell aircraft to IranAir, the Islamic republic's largest airline. Additional emails hit Clinton on her role in the loss of more than a quarter of American manufacturing jobs dating back to 1993, when former President Bill Clinton signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalized trade relations with China; accused the Clintons of laundering money through Bill s for-profit Laureate Education and touted Trump s eponymous yet defunct  university.  Clinton asked Americans to imagine Trump in the Oval Office the next time the country faces a crisis    if you can,  she said.  Imagine him being in charge when your jobs and savings are at stake.  Is this who you want to lead us in an emergency?  she asked.   Someone thin-skinned and quick to anger? Who d likely be on Twitter attacking reporters or bringing the whole regulatory system down on his critics when he should be focused on fixing what s wrong? Would he even know what to do?  She framed a Trump presidency as a step back for America, arguing that he would undo much of the progress the country has made under Obama and put the economy at risk.  Donald Trump believes in the worst of us.  He thinks we re fearful, not confident; that we favor division, not unity; walls, not bridges; and yesterday, not tomorrow,  she said.   He thinks the only way forward is to go back, to a past prosperity that left a lot of people out.  In fact, the only way forward is forward toward a 21st century version of the American dream with a modern economy and a shared prosperity where no one s left out or left behind.

I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President, Donald Trump said of his list that included former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.   Former Republican presidential candidate and Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann leads an alphabetical list of names announced by Donald Trump's campaign on Tuesday as the presumptive Republican nominee's evangelical executive advisory board. Along with Bachmann, the campaign announced the additions radio host and Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr, Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed, among more than two dozen names.  I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President, Trump said in a statement. Bachmann is the only member of Congress, past or present, named to the board. According to the statement, the board will convene on a regular basis, with some of them responsible for organizing Trump's meeting with Christian leaders Tuesday in New York City. Certain names on the list, like Dobson and Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, have made public their criticisms of Trump. Ahead of the South Carolina primary in February, Dobson recorded a robocall boosting Texas Sen.  Ted Cruz as the only viable candidate to beat Trump.  In a post on CharismaNews. com published March 3, Land acknowledged populist anger but wrote, it must be said, before it is too late, that whatever the problems may be, Donald Trump is not the answer.  I fear that the millions of Americans who are putting their trust in Mr.  Trump will be bitterly disillusioned if he were to obtain the nation's highest office. Members of the board were not asked to endorse Trump to participate, the campaign said, but rather the list represents Donald J.  Trump s endorsement of those diverse issues important to Evangelicals and other Christians, and his desire to have access to the wise counsel of such leaders as needed. The full list of board members, as shared by the campaign:   Michele Bachmann - Former Congresswoman   A. R.  Bernard - Senior Pastor and CEO, Christian Cultural Center  Mark Burns - Pastor, Harvest Praise and Worship Center  Tim Clinton - President, American Association of Christian Counselors  Kenneth and Gloria Copeland - Founders, Kenneth Copeland Ministries  James Dobson - Author, Psychologist and Host, My Family Talk  Jerry Falwell, Jr.  - President, Liberty University  Ronnie Floyd - Senior Pastor, Cross Church  Jentezen Franklin - Senior Pastor, Free Chapel  Jack Graham - Senior Pastor, Prestonwood Baptist Church  Harry Jackson - Senior Pastor, Hope Christian Church  Robert Jeffress - Senior Pastor, First Baptist Church of Dallas  David Jeremiah - Senior Pastor, Shadow Mountain Community Church  Richard Land   President, Southern Evangelical Seminary  James MacDonald   Founder and Senior Pastor, Harvest Bible Chapel  Johnnie Moore - Author, President of The KAIROS Company  Robert Morris - Senior Pastor, Gateway Church  Tom Mullins   Senior Pastor, Christ Fellowship   Ralph Reed - Founder, Faith and Freedom Coalition  James Robison - Founder, Life OUTREACH International  Tony Suarez - Executive Vice President, National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference  Jay Strack - President, Student Leadership University  Paula White - Senior Pastor, New Destiny Christian Center  Tom Winters - Attorney, Winters and King, Inc.   Sealy Yates   Attorney, Yates and Yates                  I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President, Donald Trump said of his list that included former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.   Former Republican presidential candidate and Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann leads an alphabetical list of names announced by Donald Trump's campaign on Tuesday as the presumptive Republican nominee's evangelical executive advisory board. Along with Bachmann, the campaign announced the additions radio host and Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr, Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed, among more than two dozen names.  I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President, Trump said in a statement. Bachmann is the only member of Congress, past or present, named to the board. According to the statement, the board will convene on a regular basis, with some of them responsible for organizing Trump's meeting with Christian leaders Tuesday in New York City. Certain names on the list, like Dobson and Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, have made public their criticisms of Trump. Ahead of the South Carolina primary in February, Dobson recorded a robocall boosting Texas Sen.  Ted Cruz as the only viable candidate to beat Trump.  In a post on CharismaNews. com published March 3, Land acknowledged populist anger but wrote, it must be said, before it is too late, that whatever the problems may be, Donald Trump is not the answer.

Trader Joe s promised on Tuesday to fix the leaks in its refrigerators so that keeping the mango jicama slaw and organic free range chicken cold won t hurt the atmosphere as much. The California-based grocer reached a deal with EPA and the Justice Department to spend $2 million tackling coolant leaks from refrigerators at 453 stores. The company allegedly violated the Clean Air Act by leaking R-22, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon that both hurts the ozone layer and contributes to climate change.  The law requires companies to quickly fix such leaks, and Trader Joe's also allegedly kept poor service records and failed to provide information about its compliance.  Along with the $2 million in leak repairs, which breaks down to about $4,400 per store, Trader Joe's will pay a $500,000 penalty. It has also agreed to a meet a company-wide average leak rate of 12. 1 percent through 2019   significantly below the sector average of 25 percent, according to EPA   and will use substances that do not harm the ozone layer at new stores and major remodels.  The company-wide upgrades Trader Joe s will make are not only good for the environment, they set a high bar for the grocery industry for detecting and fixing coolant leaks,  EPA enforcement chief Cynthia Giles said in a statement. EPA says the leak repairs will curb carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to 33 million pounds of burned coal, a number boosted by the extreme climate warming potency of R-22.

AFP/Just a day after Barack Obama joked that he would use LinkedIn to find a new job after he left office, Michelle Obama joined a different social media network Tuesday Snapchat, the popular picture- and video-sharing application. The White House says the first lady's account, Michelle Obama, will give users, particularly young people, behind-the-scenes access to Washington and her upcoming events and travel.  First up is next week's scheduled trip to Liberia, Morocco and Spain as part of the Let Girls Learn program, which aims to help girls around the world go to and stay in school. Stay tuned for behind-the-scenes snaps from her trip, including posts from actresses and advocates Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto, first lady press aide Kelsey Donohue wrote in a Medium post. Her first Snapchat videos include an appearance from The Late Late Show host James Corden as they film one of Corden's popular segments, Carpool Karaoke, where the British comedian drives around celebrities as they sing karaoke.

Secretary of State John Kerry said the shooting prompts people of good will to come together to fight against the killer's motives.   Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the targeted attack at the gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, saying on Tuesday that we are more shocked than truly surprised.  Whether those actions stem from bigotry, insecurity, fear, or weakness they are profoundly misguided because they prompt people of good will to close ranks in opposition to the very viciousness and bile that the killers hope to spread, he said at the Pride at State event on Tuesday morning.  No words can lift or enable us to get rid of this sense of tragedy but I do think that our gathering today can help everyone to feel less alone, Kerry added. He highlighted the efforts of people to respond to the June 12 shooting, which claimed the lives of 49 people, including President Obama's remarks when he visited the families of the victims last week.  We even saw it in New York at the UN Security Council, which for the first time explicitly condemned a hate crime based on social orientation, with Egypt and Russia among those supporting, he said. The event, which celebrated the accomplishments of organizations like GLIFAA, formerly Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies, also focused on the State Department's measures to reduce violence against the LGBT community in the U. S.  and around the world, like supporting resolutions and participating in summits.  What makes us different is that we are all created equal and we are all endowed with unalienable rights.  It is in the end what pride means, Kerry said.  To speak out for equality, to say loudly and clear no matter where you are no matter who you love,  we are with you.

Mark Cuban isn t buying Donald Trump s claim that he could self-fund his presidential campaign if he needed to.  If @realDonaldTrump were fractionally as rich as he says he is, he would write a$200mm check to propel his campaign,  the billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner wrote Tuesday on Twitter.   He doesn't have the cash.  Cuban s comments followed Trump s media offensive Tuesday, punching back against a Federal Election Commission report showing his campaign had just $1. 3 million in cash on hand at the beginning of June.  Hillary Clinton s campaign, by comparison, boasted a war chest filled with $42 million at the beginning of the month. It s not the first time that Cuban has been critical of Trump s financial claims.  The  Shark Tank  judge publicly doubted Trump s stated net worth of $10 billion, and later predicted that the real estate mogul would  have to grovel  for cash from political donors.  He has also attacked Trump s myriad business interests and has indicated he d be open to running as Hillary Clinton s vice presidential pick, a ticket Democratic insiders have deemed unlikely. Trump boasted in separate interviews on Fox News   Fox & Friends and NBC s  Today  that his paltry campaign fundraising operation wasn t paltry at all.  He said he raised $12 million for the Republican Party over the weekend on the campaign trail in Texas, Nevada and Arizona but complained that while much of the GOP has backed him, the refusal by some Republicans to get in line has hurt his wallet. Even without a unified party behind him, Trump said he could easily infuse his own money into the general election campaign, the claim that Cuban found dubious.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer wants  to prevent the possibility of another government shutdown with short-term funding bills.   House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer dismissed any chance that Republicans could deliver spending bills to the president this year, and said he s hoping for a short-term funding stopgap to keep the government open into December.    I certainly would not favor a permanent   if you mean the balance of the fiscal year   [continuing resolution,  Hoyer (D-Md. ) told reporters today when asked about potential GOP plans to kick spending debates into next year.  Current funding expires Sept.  30 and GOP leadership, particularly in the House, has struggled to get appropriations bills across the floor, even putting restrictions on the amendment process in recent weeks after a standoff with Democrats over an LGBT anti-discrimination proposal.   I do not expect the appropriations process to be done.  I think there will be very, very few, if any, bills that get to the president,  Hoyer said, adding he d like to see something like last year   a short-term patch into December followed by passage of a more wide-ranging omnibus to last through the rest of the fiscal year.   We re out of time,  he said.   I would be for an omnibus, as opposed to a CR, in December.  I think we ought to do what we did last year, at worst.

RNC spokesman Sean Spicer pushed back against reports about Donald Trump's fundraising.   AP PhotoThe Republican National Committee is pushing back against financial reports that show Donald Trump significantly trailing Hillary Clinton, saying they don t signal a struggling campaign. On Monday, financial reports showed Trump s campaign started the month of June with $1. 3 million in cash compared to Clinton s $42. 5 million.  However, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said the funds do not account for the fact that Trump has largely funded his own campaign.   That s a false narrative,  Spicer said Tuesday on CNN .   You're looking at the Trump campaign through the prism of the Hillary Clinton campaign.  Donald Trump financed his campaign all the way to this point by adding in more of his own personal money.  So it's false to say that he has $1. 3 million.  If he wanted to get that number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it's up.  Spicer added that the campaign has shifted to a  fundraising mechanism  for the general election.  If you look at the months going forward whether it's the low dollar activity that we're seeing in the mail and the phones or the people that really want to meet him at some of the in-person fund-raisers, there's tremendous intensity,  he said.   As much as I appreciate everyone's concern over our finances, when you look at it in totality year-over-year, we're doing really, really well.

But that reality didn t stop her from tearing into the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for refusing to release his tax returns.  In a four-minute video released by the progressive organization MoveOn. org, Warren blasted the billionaire businessman as a  fraud,  a  cheapskate  and a  bully  who will likely mock her with  lame new nicknames  as a result of her latest attack.  I have to be honest: It s hard to talk about Donald Trump,  Warren said at the outset of the video.   Between his ignorance, racism, sexism, lies   it s hard to know where to start.  But we ve got to start somewhere, and today I want to focus on one lie that helps sum up what Donald Trump is all about: his taxes.  Warren said Americans don t know what the real estate mogul pays in taxes because he s the first presidential nominee in decades not to disclose his tax returns.  Maybe he s just a lousy businessman who doesn t want you to find out that he s worth a lot less money than he claims   we can t know for sure.  But here's what we do know: The last time his taxes were made public, Donald Trump paid nothing in federal taxes   zero,  Warren said.   Zero taxes before, and for all we know he s paying zero taxes today.  And he s proud of it.  Trump last month boasted about paying as little taxes as possible during a telephone interview with ABC s George Stephanopoulos, arguing that the government wastes taxpayers  money by throwing it  down the drain.  Warren said Trump got rich through inheritance  and kept it going by scamming people, declaring bankruptcy and skipping out on what he owed.   But it s the taxes of everyday Americans, she stressed, that keep the real estate mogul s businesses going.  Donald Trump thinks supporting them is throwing money  down the drain.   I say we just throw Donald Trump down the drain,  Warren said.   Donald Trump is a fraud and a cheapskate   and he s a bully.  He s probably going to come up with a whole bunch of lame new nicknames for me just for filming this video.  You know why he does that? To intimidate us.  To threaten us.  To make us shut up.  But Warren won t back down, she said, encouraging others not to, either.  Whatever Donald Trump says, whatever scam he tries to pull, whatever disgusting thing he thinks he can say because he s Donald Trump   speak out,  Warren said.   Talk to the person behind you in the grocery store.  Talk to the person pumping gas next to you.  And yes, share this video with your friends.    Ask your Fox News-loving Republican uncle: Why do you pay your taxes but Donald Trump doesn t?  she continued.   If Donald Trump doesn t even believe in paying his fair share for government, we shouldn t put him in charge of the government.  If we re going to build a future   not just for the rich and powerful, but for everybody   then it s time for all of us to fight back.

Donald Trump said he could put up an unlimited amount of his own money if he had to.   Donald Trump defended his campaign's meager war chest on Tuesday, boasting that he could put up his own money in order to defeat Hillary Clinton if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign at this point.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Monday's Federal Election Commission filings showed Clinton with more than $42 million on hand by the end of May, while Trump had $1. 3 million, less than some congressional and gubernatorial candidates. In its statement, the campaign asserted that June is the first month of fundraising activity outside of Trump's self-funding and that that will be reflected in the report to be filed next month.  The campaign also pointed to the fact that Trump did not hold any official fundraising events until May 25, when the presumptive Republican nominee hosted a $25,000-per-ticket dinner at the California home of real estate investor Thomas Barrack. To date, the campaign s fundraising has been incredible and we continue to see a tremendous outpouring of support for Mr.  Trump and money to the Republican Party.  The positive response to our fundraising efforts so far is a further indication that the country does not want yet another corrupt politician like Crooked Hillary, the campaign said.

Donald Trump s campaign started the month with a paltry $1. 3 million in cash   a mere fraction of Hillary Clinton's $42. 5 million war chest   putting the GOP front-runner at a sharp disadvantage heading into the general election against Clinton s money machine.  On the same day that Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, amid a steady stream of reports of campaign infighting and disorganization, the latest batch of Federal Election Commission filings show that the real estate mogul has a long way to go to establish a financial operation that can compete at the national level.  And it s not just money   the filings revealed a campaign staff of less than 70, a number dwarfed by Clinton s nearly 700 paid employees, and few of the campaign s expenses suggested work had begun to build out a more robust operation.  All together, it s the most lopsided fundraising start to a presidential election in the modern campaign finance era. The filings detail campaign finances covering the month of May, during which Trump locked up the GOP nomination after the May 3 Indiana primary.  Republicans had hoped that Trump s clearing of the field would prompt their donors to rally behind their presumptive nominee and allow him to close the gap with Clinton s campaign, which was still struggling to finish off primary rival Bernie Sanders. Instead, the campaign showed no clear path for improving its financial picture.  Trump raised just $3. 1 million from donors (including almost $2 million in amounts less than $200) and lent his campaign $2. 2 million, though he said he won t continue self-funding through the general election.  Trump has now loaned his campaign a total of $45. 7 million, almost exactly the same amount that Mitt Romney loaned his 2008 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.  Unlike Romney, who mostly downplayed his wealth, Trump s boasts about his wealth and his willingness to self-finance his campaign were a central part of his message during the primary.  Trump castigated his primary opponents for being beholden to big donors and called out the donors as puppet masters.  So when Trump decided that he would seek to raise outside money for his own election, the reversal was awkward, not least because he had failed to assemble a finance operation for his skeletal campaign. On the bright side, Trump's campaign trimmed spending from $9. 4 million in April to $6. 7 million in May.  But with so little money in the bank, frugality alone won't make the operation more competitive.  Even the defunct campaigns of Ted Cruz and Ben Carson had more cash on hand than Trump s.  In fact, several House members running for reelection have more cash on hand than Trump s campaign.  Peter King (R-N. Y. ) had $3 million, Joe Kennedy (D-Mass. ) reported $2. 2 million, Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N. Y. ) and Lee Zeldin (R-N. Y. ) each reported about $1. 8 million, and Mike Coffman (R-Colo. ) had $1. 4 million.  Comparing cash figures was always a little spurious in the primaries, with Trump poised to pump more money into his own campaign (despite conflicting accounts of his actual wealth and liquidity).  But he has made clear he won t bankroll his bid through November, and he s still a long way from the $300 million his backers say they hope to raise   already a retreat from Trump's original $1 billion goal.  Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign and its allied super PAC have already amassed more than $300 million. The May FEC report showed just 69 people on payroll, to Clinton s 685.  And the Trump campaign s spending offered no signs that it is building a national campaign infrastructure.  The biggest expenditures included $350,000 for the use of Trump s private jet; $493,000 to rent Trump facilities such as Mar-A-Lago, the Trump winery and two of his golf clubs; and $208,000 on hats. By comparison, the campaign spent only $48,000 on data management and $115,000 on online advertising. The campaign, which has been hounded by sometimes violent protests and disruptions, paid the Secret Service $179,000 and $59,000 to private security company XMark. One sign of a fledgling fundraising operation was $3 million raised for the Republican National Committee through Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee formed late in the month. The campaign spent just $227,500 on direct mail, $150,000 on placed media and $80,000 on online advertising, according to the FEC filing. The Trump campaign has yet to reserve any air time for advertising in the fall, and he might not be able to rely on super PACs.  The real estate mogul s inflammatory attacks on a federal judge and renewed calls for a ban on Muslim immigration have failed to endear him to the party s leading donors, and one of the main outside groups supporting him, Great America PAC, raised just $1. 4 million in May.

NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.  But as they left, many prominent figures indicated that Trump still hasn't sealed the deal. When eight leading Christian conservatives   including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Sealy Yates of Trump s evangelical advisory committee and Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B.  Anthony List   lined up for a news conference following a meeting with the candidate, not a single one was ready to fully endorse Trump and grant him access to their extensive networks of grass-roots activists. What they and other attendees offered instead was qualified encouragement for Trump, as many remarked that he had helped move them closer to an endorsement. That s a better take on Trump than many of the same leaders offered during the primary contests, but it still spells trouble.  At a stage of the campaign in which candidates are typically working to win over moderates and independents, the presumptive GOP nominee is still working to nail down support from one of his own party s core constituencies: Christian conservatives. On Tuesday, Trump made a full-throated appeal to religious Republicans.  Hundreds of evangelicals convened at a closed-door session at the cavernous Marriott Marquis in Times Square here for an all-day confab that featured appearances from various Trump representatives, including Ben Carson and Eric Trump, along with Trump himself. He used the meeting to paper over past differences with evangelicals, many of whom preferred Ted Cruz, Ben Carson or a host of other candidates over the eventual winner, as well as to highlight some areas of common ground, especially regarding his support for anti-abortion Supreme Court justices.  I ve been a Christian, and I love Christianity and the evangelicals have been so incredibly supportive,  Trump said in the private session, according to audio obtained by POLITICO.   Don t forget, when I ran, and all of a sudden I went to states that were highly evangelical, like as an example, South Carolina, and they said,  Well, Trump won t win this state because it s evangelical    not only did I win, I won in a landslide.   They really get me,  he continued, of evangelicals.   They understand.  And certainly, many of the die-hard conservatives here, who have no appetite for supporting Hillary Clinton, want a reason to get behind the GOP nominee.  By simply showing up, he moved closer to giving them one   but his work remains cut out for him.  I certainly liked what I saw today,  said Dr.  James Dobson, a veteran social conservative leader and previously vocal Trump critic. But despite being listed by the campaign as a member of Trump s evangelical advisory board, he said he wasn t yet prepared to endorse (endorsements weren t a requirement for joining the board).  It s early in the process, and there s plenty of time,  Dobson said, less than one month before the Republican National Convention commences.   But again, I m pleased by what I saw today.  That s about as far as I can go.  In an interview before the gathering, Perkins   a former Cruz backer   said he hoped to be able to eventually endorse Trump.   Because of the alternative, I would like to be at a point where I find that I can support him,  he said.   If I can support him, I think many other evangelical social conservatives can as well.  But it s going to be difficult because clearly there s a division right now in the evangelical ranks.  On Tuesday, Perkins said that the  conversation has begun today  and was complimentary of Trump, but said that he s still waiting to see whom Trump selects as a running mate, and how he reacts to a potentially very conservative platform at the RNC.  Is he learning in this process? I think he is,  Perkins said.   Now it s important [to see who he has around him.  In addition to giving the main address, Trump also met with about 50 of the country s most influential Christian conservative leaders, including Penny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America; Dannenfelser (who later said she would personally support backing Trump, but didn t know yet what the selection committee of her organization s political arm would do); and Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. , Nance said.  There, Trump railed against a culture of political correctness and stressed his support for defending religious liberty. There s more outreach to come.  Trump s campaign on Tuesday unveiled a list of more than two dozen Christian leaders who are members of his evangelical advisory board, including former Rep.  Michele Bachmann, Dobson, Falwell and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Trump needs those efforts to bear fruit.  Conservative Christians are an essential part of the GOP base, and turning them out is crucial for Republicans.  While Trump did win a significant slice of evangelical voters during the primary, as he noted to the group, many of the key leaders of the movement have stayed on the sidelines, depriving Trump of core activist support and sending a signal to other evangelicals that this election may be worth skipping, even as they remain steadfastly opposed to Clinton. The real estate mogul s past more-liberal record on social issues is still of significant concern, as is his history of antagonizing various minority groups, including prisoners of war and people with disabilities.  The awkward fit was on full display Tuesday when Trump posed for a photo with the Falwells.  In tweeting the photo, Falwell Jr.  said he was excited to be introducing Trump, but many pointed out that the trio was posing in front of a framed cover of Playboy magazine. Tuesday s events more broadly were aimed at strengthening the ties between Trump and the constituency he hopes to energize. Both the format and the moderator were sympathetic to that aim.  Former Arkansas Gov.  Mike Huckabee struck a reassuring and solicitous tone as he moderated the event.  Attendees weren t looking to elect a pastor, he told Trump, who last summer said he has never asked God for forgiveness.  There was no opportunity for follow-up questions or further probing on issues. Only a handful of questions   about Israel, religious liberty and immigration   were taken, and some attendees were disappointed that time ran out before Trump could be asked about abortion, an issue on which he s switched positions several times.  There s some things I d like to talk to him about, to hear a little more from him on the specific issue of Planned Parenthood,  Nance said.   But he really didn t hurt himself today.  He did, however, stress his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, saying that a conservative court would go a long way toward protecting anti-abortion measures, religious liberty and gun rights.  Trump repeatedly painted the election as a choice between his conservative court picks and Hillary Clinton s more reliably liberal ones.                             Clergy leaders demonstrate on June 21 in New York where Donald Trump is scheduled to meet evangelical clergy.    AP Photo These will be Supreme Court justices that will be intellects, that will be talented men in what they do   and women   and also be pro-life,  he said, noting that in addition to the list of possible Supreme Court justices he has already released, he might have four or five names to add to the list down the road.  This next president   could have five justices in the Supreme Court,  he said.   Probably three, very possibly four, it could even be five.  If Hillary Clinton gets in, we know what she s going to put in there, we know what s going to happen.    We re going to end up being Venezuela, if she gets in, for a lot of different reasons.  Ultimately, the attendees  opposition to Clinton may be Trump s best hope for pulling their enthusiastic support, and he played to that anger Tuesday when he questioned Clinton s faith and suggested she would be problematic for religious Christians. But Reed, of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said that Trump gave attendees reason to be actively excited about him as well.  I think he had a good day,  he told reporters from POLITICO and National Review, going on to add,  He showed up.  He came to a meeting of over a thousand Christian leaders and spent hours hearing their concerns, receiving their wisdom and their counsel, and answering their questions.  And the second thing is, he made it very clear on matters of life, religious freedom, support for Israel, he stands with them.  Trump also suggested that he believes Christianity is under attack, a view shared by many in the room.  I ve talked about a temporary ban on Muslims, until we find out what s going on,  he said.   I was met with   everything.  Some people thought, great, some people didn t think so great.  If I said something about Christianity, it would be a whole different ballgame.  We can t let that happen, folks.  After Trump effectively clinched the nomination in May, many evangelical leaders grappled both with whether to endorse him, and, if they reached that point, whether to activate their extensive grass-roots networks on his behalf.  It was a question several top leaders in attendance were still pondering Tuesday as they left.  The choice isn t between supporting him and Hillary,  Nance said.   It s between supporting him, turning out the people they influence, or doing nothing.  She remains undecided as to her next step, as does Perkins. For Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative activist, it s an easier call.  Bauer, who was supporting Cruz, said he had to decided both to back Trump and to use his political organization to assist the presumptive GOP nominee.  He is planning a more formal endorsement in the coming weeks.  Look, it s a binary decision,  he said, going on to add.   We ll definitely be promoting the ideas that we agree with that he s standing for.  Outside the Marriott, a lone figure in a blue suit stood waging his own personal protest. Eric Teetsel, a Christian activist who ran religious outreach for Marco Rubio, stood by himself with a sign.   Torture is not pro-life,  his sign read.   Racism is not pro-life.  Misogyny is not pro-life.  Murdering the children of terrorists is not pro-life.   I may be standing here by myself, but I know I m not alone,  Teetsel said, going on to add,  There are millions of Christians who look at the candidates in this race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and say,  I can t vote for either of them in good conscience.   And they are wondering what to do.   NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.

And they are wondering what to do.                   Donald Trump questioned Hillary Clinton's faith at a closed meeting.   Donald Trump questioned his Democratic opponent s Christian faith Tuesday, telling a closed meeting with top Christian leaders that  we don t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.   Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no -- there's nothing out there.  There's like nothing out there,  the presumptive Republican nominee said in a video released on Twitter by Virginia Christian conservative (and former Senate candidate) E. W.  Jackson.  It's going to be an extension of Obama but it's going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up; with Hillary you don't, and it's going to be worse,  Trump added on Tuesday. He also criticized politicians' handling of religious matters, particularly relating to Evangelicals and Christianity.  All of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes, selling the Evangelicals down the tubes.  And it's a very, very, uh, very, very bad thing that's happening, Trump said.  But Clinton has previously said she is Methodist and has talked on various occasions about her religion, including on the campaign trail.  Evangelical leader Deborah Fikes, who also announced her endorsement of Clinton on Tuesday, weighed in on Mr.  Trump's comments in a statement, saying his proposals are not just un-Christian-- they are un-American.  In my personal capacity of working with over 130 National Evangelical Alliances around the globe,  Sister Hillary  as she is often called, is embraced by many Evangelical sister churches as a trustworthy and respected political leader because she lives the Golden Rule in her private life and in her public policies, Fikes added. Katrina Pierson, spokesperson for Trump's campaign, told MSNBC that his comments were referring to the double standard, since his religion has been questioned along the campaign trail. We are talking about the Democratic party, a party that voted God out of their actual platform nationally so I think that is interesting and considering how we have people all over the globe, Christians being beheaded, and yet here in the United States, this administration, the Clinton/Obama policy of political correctness, essentially not even wanting to talk and say what's going on, that's happening to Christians all across the country, Pierson added, referencing the vote Democrats made at their 2012 convention to keep God out of their platform, which was quickly reversed.  They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race, said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank, said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was almost so low that it's not even comprehendable.  After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading THE FIRST ONE.  Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort, said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.  By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.  I was very involved in Mitt Romney's fundraising effort in 2008, and immediately after he got out of the primary he got his team together and he said we all need to get behind John McCain, and I ended up raising more money that year for John McCain than I did for Mitt Romney by the time the election ended, Tanenblatt said.  There wasn't that effort with regard to the Trump campaign because the Trump campaign didn't raise money on their own and didn't reach out to supporters of the other candidates like donors are accustomed.  Typically, the nominee is the one who is magnanimous and reaches out to the supporters of the other campaigns and unifies and works to unify the party.  I don't think that happened to the extent it should have. Defending his campaign's financial situation on Tuesday, Trump pointed out that he could simply reach into his own wallet if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Still, those who worked for Trump's vanquished rivals, while fretting that Clinton s war chest so dramatically eclipses Trump's, were unable to resist the temptation to knock the real estate mogul's funding strategy.  I thought he was self funding? ;), a chief strategist for one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump early in the GOP primary wrote in an email.  Several Republicans argued that it's unlikely that the GOP donor class will make a mad rush to close the money gap between Clinton and Trump, since there's still a strong distaste for Trump among some donors.  Those feelings go both ways: One Republican donor who recently met with then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recalled him suggesting that Trump strongly disliked asking major GOP donors for money. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the donors that have been loyal Republican supporters over the past few election cycles have been vilified by Trump, and he said that he could win without them and was going to self-fund, so they're not inspired to jump on board with significant donations, said Spies.  What would possibly move them to support him would be across-the-board enthusiasm about the nominee or a bandwagon effect.  I mean, if all your friends are giving, you don't want to be left out, but this number is an indication that none of your friends are giving, so why would you be the guy out front supporting Trump when nobody else is?A former bundler for Jeb Bush was even more direct about his disinterest in helping Trump.  This is a guy who lent himself $30 [million or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back.  This is a total fraud.  He's a fraud, the former Bush bundler said, referring to the fact that Trump loaned his campaign the cash and could still repay himself.  There's a universe of, I don't know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who's not going to [contribute.  So that's part of it.  And I think we're just not going to stick our necks out for that.  This isn't a situation like Ben Carson, where he's blowing through money like nobody's business.  I don't think that s blowing through tons of money.  They didn't have a huge staff to begin with.  They're not fully staffed to run a national campaign. The question now, Tanenblatt said, is what Trump does going forward in terms of picking a vice-presidential candidate and what he says in public.  That could determine whether his fundraising picks up or not.  I think that says a lot about him as a candidate,  Tanenblatt said.   That's probably the biggest decision that he's going to make in the campaign, so that will send a signal.  David Tamasi, a former fundraiser for New Jersey Gov.  Chris Christie's presidential campaign, stressed that it's still a long way until Election Day, and he said Republicans shouldn t read too much into May fundraising numbers.  It's easy to look at May and compare that to somebody who's had a 25-year start to make some sort of comparison, none of which are flattering, but I think it's an inaccurate portrayal of where things will be once things get hot, Tamasi said.  They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race, said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank, said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was almost so low that it's not even comprehendable.  After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading THE FIRST ONE.  Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort, said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.  By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.

COLUMBUS, Ohio   In presidential politics, the spoils go to the candidates who define their opponents first.  That s why Hillary Clinton's effort to define Donald Trump is now in overdrive. Taking dead aim at her Republican rival for the second time this month in a policy speech, the presumptive Democratic nominee swung hard at Trump s economic record on Tuesday afternoon while some of her highest-profile surrogates ratcheted up their own attacks in stereo.  The timing was as notable as the forcefulness of her criticism: It came while Trump was plainly reeling from a series of self-imposed campaign mishaps.  Clinton s assault came just hours after Trump disclosed that he had far less cash on hand than any other modern presidential campaign to this point, and one day after he fired his controversial campaign manager.  It will be capped by an even broader attempt to lock in her advantage: a still-growing series of ad buys adding up to at least $50 million from the campaign and super PAC, designed to blanket battleground state airwaves for weeks before Trump can afford a response.  There s a natural window to communicate in late spring before people tune out for the summer, and presidential [campaigns have to lay their message groundwork in that limited time,  said David Cohen, a leading member of Barack Obama s field team in 2008.   But there s a confluence of events that heighten the opportunity for the Clinton camp: Trump squandered his moment right after he clinched [the GOP nomination, the party is in turmoil so he s seriously lacking allies, he s got no general election message and can t seem to even do message basics, organizationally he s months behind in building battleground state infrastructure, and the latest finance reports are devastating.   Meanwhile,  Cohen noted,  the Clinton team has spent a year building infrastructure to capture every opportunity.  They were already going to start pushing their general election message at this point, but now they re able to really press their advantage aggressively. Flanked on Tuesday by blue banners trumpeting her new Stronger Together campaign slogan, Clinton drew a direct parallel to the early June address in San Diego when she ripped into Trump s fitness to be commander in chief.   A few weeks ago, I said his foreign policy proposals and reckless statements represent a danger to our national security.  But you might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman he would be better prepared to handle the economy,  she said.   Well, it turns out he s dangerous there, too,  she continued, insisting that her Trump critique went beyond typical partisan concerns with Republicans  economics.   Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  Clinton later alluded to a Monday report from Moody s Analytics that predicted a recession if Trump s economic proposals were enacted while laying into his own business record:  He s written a lot of books about business.  They all seem to end at Chapter 11.  Go figure. Deep into the speech, she dove into Trump s refusal to disclose his tax returns, speculating that he s either not as wealthy as he says he is, that he's giving less to charity than he says, or that he s not paying any taxes at all   a line of reasoning that directly echoed a video published by Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren, the liberal hero and newly minted Clinton endorser, for MoveOn. org just hours earlier.   It is hard to talk about Donald Trump,  Warren said in the video, shortly before sending her first fundraising email for Clinton s camp.   Between his ignorance, his racism, his sexism, his lies, it is actually hard to know where to start.  The Wall Street antagonist, frequently mentioned as a vice presidential contender, represented just one plank of the Clinton surrogates  attacks on Trump s economic platform.  Helping introduce Clinton on Tuesday in Columbus, former Ohio Democratic Gov.  Ted Strickland, currently a Senate candidate, said Trump  is not qualified to lead a parade.  Back in Washington another Ohioan   Sen.  Sherrod Brown, also on the vice presidential watchlist   unleashed an unexpected Trump broadside of his own, inveighing against him at a Federal Reserve hearing as a  factory of bad ideas.     If your own very good brain is your top consultant, I suppose the unanimous opinion of a diverse group of economists does not count for much,  Brown said of Trump s wish to return to the gold standard.   For those of us in the evidence-based world, the prospect of this nominee trading imagined for real authority gives added significance to what we do in Congress.  The partywide anti-Trump barrage, coming after a weekend-long show of organizing force as the Clinton campaign sought to register and mobilize voters in the swing states   contrasting with Trump s much smaller field program   was met with an uncharacteristically regimented response from Trump. The Republican not only sent out his first wide-circulation small-dollar fundraising email and rescheduled a long-anticipated anti-Clinton speech for Wednesday, but he also inaugurated his campaign s rapid-response operation, unleashing a flurry of emails and coordinated tweets during Clinton s speech like he never has before.  For Trump, the fight was on friendly terrain   on the economic issue, he frequently leads or ties Clinton in nationwide polling.  But for the Clinton campaign, it was an opportunity to try to push his negative ratings as high as possible before he fully professionalizes his communications team, as some expect him to do now under a new campaign leader. Sentiment  is definitely shifting, and it s going to take time, it s going to take the commercials, her doing the grass-top messaging, and the surrogates going out into labor union halls and other places to really try to get the message out at different levels,  said Rep.  Tim Ryan of Ohio, a Clinton supporter who s campaigned with her in the swing state.  When you peel the onion back, he s not for them, and that s what s getting out.  He s going to have a rough time wiggling out of that.  COLUMBUS, Ohio   In presidential politics, the spoils go to the candidates who define their opponents first.

He s going to have a rough time wiggling out of that.  As Hillary Clinton spoke Tuesday, Donald Trump s campaign blasted out nine rapid-response emails to counter the Democrat s narrative that he would be disastrous for the country s economy.  Trump trashed Clinton on Twitter as well but didn't use his  Crooked Hillary  nickname. However cosmetic, the changes were noteworthy just one day after the firing of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who everyone from campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump s adult children believed had impeded efforts to professionalize Trump s unconventional operation.  The rapid response emails, which included myriad statistics about the country s slow economic recovery under the Obama administration, are one indication that the campaign heard criticism about its slow response to Clinton s last speech.  They re also an indication that Manafort intends to make Trump s campaign more disciplined and professional.  And Trump family confidant Michael Cohen, a top executive in Trump s corporation, said the candidate s three adult children   who, along with son-in-law Jared Kushner, were all involved in Lewandowski s firing   would be taking on greater roles both inside the operation and as surrogates for the candidate himself.  They re all incredibly bright, well-spoken and articulate advocates for their father, especially in dispelling some of the false reporting against Mr.  Trump by the liberal mainstream media,  Cohen said. But many Republicans, both supporters and skeptics of Trump s campaign, note that the consolidation of power by Manafort and the children does not guarantee any change in the candidate himself, whose undisciplined past few weeks   from his racially tinged criticism of a federal judge to his off-key, self-congratulatory response to the Orlando terrorist attack   have discouraged donors and leery Republicans who d still been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. In a news release Tuesday night, Trump's campaign confirmed that it has beefed up its communications staff while formally announcing several hires, including a national political director and a director of surrogates, made in recent weeks.  But the campaign also rolled out a new website using the very phrase he avoided in his tweets, lyingcrookedhillary. com.  The site isn't live yet. On Wednesday, Trump is set to give a speech that will seek to outline his argument against Clinton, who made her first, focused speech criticizing him nearly a month ago.  Seven weeks after securing the GOP nomination, Trump has struggled to fully pivot into general election mode.  Many observers both inside and outside the campaign will be watching for signs that Trump has reined in his shoot-from-the-hip excesses. Trump s children have long blamed Lewandowski and his  let Trump be Trump  strategy for their father s recent struggles   and for driving a wedge between Trump and advisers who dared suggest the candidate who ran roughshod over 16 GOP primary challengers needs to adjust his approach for the general election. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Kushner, whose influence has grown in recent months, had been trying to convince nervous, more mainstream Republicans that Trump was just doing what he had to do to win the primary and that a pivot was imminent.   They told people he inherently understood the tone and temperament required of a general election and that the real Trump was sophisticated, charming, successful   a dealmaker who would be able to cut the deal,  one high-level GOP source said.  But in the last six weeks, the best dealmaker of all time can't close the deal with his own party, and it s based on his temperament.  It's not issues, it's that people think he's mentally unfit to be president.  Manafort is working to build out the communications staff, a venture Lewandowski had repeatedly blocked. Beyond messaging, Trump has yet to spend significant time campaigning in swing states, traveling last week to deeply red states like Texas in order to play catch-up on the fundraising front.  On Tuesday, he continued his outreach to a core Republican constituency, meeting with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower in another effort to unify a fractured conservative coalition.  None of the eight organizers of the meeting was willing to officially endorse Trump afterward. Nor does this week s campaign shakeup obscure Trump s staggering financial disadvantage or the Republican Party s attempts to paint a more positive picture of the reality that its presumptive presidential nominee has less cash on hand than many congressional candidates. Sean Spicer, the RNC communications director, said it s silly to compare Trump s $1. 3 million cash-on-hand total to Clinton s $42. 5 million sum because the billionaire has self-financed much of his campaign to date.   If he wanted to get that number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it s up.  Trump himself vowed Tuesday to match any soft money contributions made over the following 48 hours up to $2 million, another effort to portray the situation as far from bleak but one that could backfire should donors believe that the campaign s finances are in good shape.  Part of the problem is he keeps saying,  I m gonna put that kind of money in,  which makes it very difficult for donors and   and someone like myself to try and raise money for him in a super PAC,  Ed Rollins, who formed a pro-Trump super PAC that has failed to gain traction, said Tuesday during an appearance on Fox Business Network.   People say 'Well, he says he can buy it himself.  Let him put the money in.   In the month since he became the presumptive GOP nominee, Trump raised just $3. 1 million; by comparison, Mitt Romney raised more than $23 million in the month after he clinched the nomination in 2012.  Of the $6. 7 million Trump s campaign has spent, roughly 20 percent (CNN says 17 percent) has gone to Trump-owned businesses.  Continuing to rely almost completely on his large media presence, Trump has spent almost nothing to date on data programs, television advertising and direct mail.  Trump and the RNC are holding a joint fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday night, but only a fraction of the money raised will go to his campaign. Two things are giving donors hesitation: that he's not doing well now, and that he's rich and can self-fund, said Charlie Black, an experienced GOP operative in Washington and Manafort s former partner.  And they haven't had a professional fundraising operation so far.  But he's cleared the deck of the divided leadership, and now [Manafort has the clear path to go and professionalize it.  He's got to make a bunch of phone calls, and he's got to staff up, said Austin Barbour, who served as a national finance chair for Romney's 2012 campaign.  Talking isn't going to get him there, he's got to do it.  And he's the tip of the spear when it comes to helping Republicans with the down-ballot campaigns. Just weeks ahead of the convention in Cleveland, Trump s woes have only added to Republicans  concerns about his candidacy and the negative impact he could have on down-ballot races.  And the presumptive nominee has yet to completely quiet chatter about the party s nuclear option: changing RNC rules a week ahead of the convention in order to unbind the delegates on a first ballot to allow them to nominate someone other than Trump. Gov.  Scott Walker, the former candidate who has hinted he d be open to receiving the nomination in such a circumstance, said Tuesday the delegates  should be able to vote the way they see fit.

Of the $6. 7 million Trump s campaign has spent, roughly 20 percent (CNN says 17 percent) has gone to Trump-owned businesses.  Continuing to rely almost completely on his large media presence, Trump has spent almost nothing to date on data programs, television advertising and direct mail.  Trump and the RNC are holding a joint fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday night, but only a fraction of the money raised will go to his campaign. Two things are giving donors hesitation: that he's not doing well now, and that he's rich and can self-fund, said Charlie Black, an experienced GOP operative in Washington and Manafort s former partner.  And they haven't had a professional fundraising operation so far.  But he's cleared the deck of the divided leadership, and now [Manafort has the clear path to go and professionalize it.  He's got to make a bunch of phone calls, and he's got to staff up, said Austin Barbour, who served as a national finance chair for Romney's 2012 campaign.  Talking isn't going to get him there, he's got to do it.  And he's the tip of the spear when it comes to helping Republicans with the down-ballot campaigns. Just weeks ahead of the convention in Cleveland, Trump s woes have only added to Republicans  concerns about his candidacy and the negative impact he could have on down-ballot races.  And the presumptive nominee has yet to completely quiet chatter about the party s nuclear option: changing RNC rules a week ahead of the convention in order to unbind the delegates on a first ballot to allow them to nominate someone other than Trump. Gov.  Scott Walker, the former candidate who has hinted he d be open to receiving the nomination in such a circumstance, said Tuesday the delegates  should be able to vote the way they see fit.

AP PhotoThe House will not vote to block the inclusion of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, dodging a politically-charged vote for GOP lawmakers. Rep.  Steve King (R-Iowa) had filed an amendment to a bill funding the Treasury Department to prohibit the department from redesigning any currency to showcase the abolitionist icon, but the Rules Committee denied floor consideration of the proposal Tuesday night. It's not about Harriet Tubman, it's about keeping the picture on the $20, King said Tuesday evening, pulling a $20 bill from his pocket and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.  Y'know? Why would you want to change that? I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have. The conservative gadfly said it is racist and sexist to say a woman or person of color should be added to currency.  Here's what's really happening, this is liberal activism on the part of the president, that's trying to identify people by categories and he's divided us on the lines of groups.  . . .  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president and mine's unifying.  It says just don't change anything. The Treasury Department announced in April that it would move the image of Jackson to the back of the twenty-dollar note, replacing him with Tubman, a former slave who helped other slaves escape to freedom and served with the Union Army during the Civil War.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also announced plans to redesign $5 and $10 bills to include leaders from the women's rights and civil rights movements.  Neither Abraham Lincoln nor former Alexander Hamilton would be removed from their spots on the front of the $5 and $10 notes. King is not alone among Republicans opposed to placing the abolitionist and civil rights icon on the $20 bill.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in April that the move was pure political correctness, and recommended that an image of Tubman be placed on the $2 bill. Amendments to appropriations bills have proven troublesome to Republicans in recent weeks.  After a Democratic amendment to prohibit discrimination by federal contractors against LGBT people was added to bill funding energy and water programs, Republicans dropped their support for the measure, and it was defeated.  That kerfuffle led Speaker Paul Ryan to go back on his commitment to allow for an open amendment process and instead limit which amendments could be considered. The Rules Committee blocked consideration of the LGBT amendment, as it has in recent weeks.  The willingness of the GOP-controlled panel to stymie a fellow Republican, particularly amid conservative frustration with a limited amendment process, demonstrates the desire to avoid controversial votes in an election year. King, for his part, saw the amendment as crucial. President Obama's on his way out the door, he said.

By Tuesday, Michael Caputo was publicly ripping Corey Lewandowski (pictured above) once again.   AP PhotoOn Monday, Michael Caputo had to tender his resignation to the Donald Trump campaign after publicly celebrating the dismissal of fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But by Tuesday, Caputo was publicly ripping Lewandowski once again.  I shouldn t have tweeted about Corey s demise, but count me as one munchkin still celebrating it,  he said Tuesday on the talk show Political Pulse.  Caputo was referencing a Monday tweet in which he said  Ding dong the witch is dead!  in a thinly veiled shot at the fired Lewandowski. Caputo resigned a few hours later, saying he had become a distraction, but that doesn't mean he's dropping his beef with Lewandowski.  I ve been in this politics game for a while and I ve never seen anything like fired Trump manager Corey Lewandowski.  I don t want to belabor the point, he s gone, and Donald Trump is far better off.  But Corey took great pleasure in antagonizing his rivals,  he added.  Caputo also said he was still  100% behind Trump  and that the change in leadership would bring  remarkable difference immediately.  Donald Trump Jr.  confirmed on Monday afternoon the family had influenced Trump s decision to fire Lewandowski, who had been working on the campaign since it launched last June.                  POLITICO screengrabDonald Trump s campaign on Tuesday dismissed Hillary Clinton s criticisms of the real estate mogul s business record, pointing to Walt Disney and Henry Ford as success stories with similar records. Clinton forcefully attacked Trump s business record in a speech on Tuesday, questioning the billionaire s wealth, ridiculing his failed business ventures and accusing him of intentionally running up companies  debt and then defaulting.  But Trump s campaign argued that Clinton s remarks show how little the former secretary of state knows about businesses.  Taking a couple of entities and comparing that to the 500-plus that Donald Trump has been very successful in just goes to show you that Hillary Clinton has no idea what this country is about,  Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNN s Wolf Blitzer. What America is about, Pierson said, is people having ideas, fighting for their dreams and building things.  Hillary Clinton has built absolutely nothing in this country,  Pierson said.   It s Donald Trump that has created tens of thousands of jobs over the last few decades.  This is exactly why he s winning on the economy.  In her remarks at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton noted that Trump has filed for bankruptcy four times and even joked that all of the real estate mogul s books seem to end at Chapter 11.  (This particular zinger was not true: Trump's Art of the Deal, for instance, has 14 chapters. )An excerpt of Katrina Pierson's interview on Tuesday.  Pierson, however, countered that entrepreneurial geniuses like Walt Disney and Henry Ford didn t have a 100 percent success rate in their business ventures, either.  It's actually not a long list when you are looking at all of the businesses that Mr.  Trump has been in,  Pierson said of Trump s failures.   Look at Walt Disney.  He wasn t successful in all of his adventures.  Look at Henry Ford.  These are successful business people who tried things, who are entrepreneurs.   To sit there and criticize one or two companies that did or didn't make it just goes to show how Hillary Clinton has no idea what it s going to take to make America great again,  Pierson said.                   I don t criticize them for saying what they did, because actually, it s true,  Harry Reid told reporters Tuesday.    Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev. ), are doubling down on their attacks on Republicans for failing to pass gun control legislation. It began with Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) telling the Washington Post on Monday that Republicans  have decided to sell weapons to ISIS  after his filibuster last week that lasted nearly 15 hours. Then, the Senate blocked four gun control bills Monday night along largely partisan lines, including legislation that would have banned gun sales to individuals on the terror watch list.  Following the votes, Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) echoed Murphy s comments, tweeting,  The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.  On Tuesday, Murphy and Warren received support from top Democratic leaders.  Asked if such rhetoric was responsible, Reid said that Democratic efforts would have likely stopped terrorist shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando.  I don t criticize them for saying what they did, because actually, it s true,  Reid told reporters Tuesday.  White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was unaware of Warren s tweet, but backed the general sentiment.   It is without question possible for suspected terrorists to buy guns because Republicans are protecting their ability to do so,  he said.  Burgess Everett contributed reporting.                   Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas on June 18.   Donald Trump launched a new allegation at Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, accusing her of having laundered money through a for-profit university while she was secretary of state. In a rapid-response email blast sent during Clinton s speech attacking Trump s economic proposals, the billionaire s campaign accused the former secretary of state of funneling government money to Laureate Education, a for-profit chain of universities that employed Bill Clinton as honorary chancellor until April 2015. The former president made $16. 5 million over his five years in that position while his wife added Laureate to the State Department Global Partnership.  Trump alleges the Department of State awarded $55. 2 million in grants to Laureate, an accusation that is not quite accurate since there is no indication that State Department money flowed directly to the for-profit education chain.  According to Bloomberg, the $55. 2 million in State Department and USAID grant money actually went to the International Youth Foundation, a non-profit group headed by Laurate Education Chairman Douglas Becker. That same Bloomberg investigation showed that the IYF received $9 million in State Department grants in 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate.  The number jumped to $15. 1 million in 2010, Bill Clinton's first year with Laureate, and ballooned to $25. 5 million in grants in 2012.  This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle,  Trump s email read.   Laureate made money by racking up student debt on vulnerable students.  Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by pointing to IYF's history of working with the State Department and USAID that dates back to the George W.  Bush administration. This is yet another false allegation from Donald Trump, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.  The International Youth Foundation was funded by the Bush administration, well before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.  In fact, the non-profit's USAID funding actually went down in the year that she arrived at the State Department, not up. International Youth Foundation CEO and President Bill Reese dismissed as  totally erroneous  and  ridiculous  the suggestion by Trump or anybody else that the foundation had been the beneficiary of political quid-pro-quo.  He said all of the foundation s grants have been won competitively and that the non-profit goes through rigorous, government-mandated audit processes that would have caught any money being steered from IYF back to Laureate.  If there was government money going back to a private company, let alone a board member s company, my God it would all have to be reported,  Reese said.   Or we d be in violation of OMB regulations, of IRS regulations, of normal auditing practice by non-profits.  It s just, it s crazy.  Reese said the uptick in government money beginning in 2010 came from grants awarded during both the Obama and Bush administrations that paid out over the course of several years and had no correlation to Bill Clinton s position with Laureate. Reese also conceded that Becker does sit on the IYF s board of directors but said the Laureate chairman is just one of many high-profile board members, including the CEO and President of Hilton Worldwide and a former Senior Vice President of Saudi Arabia s national oil and gas company, Saudi Aramco.   It would be laughable,  Reese said of Trump s accusation.   But it s no laughing matter to be accused of things that of course have no factual basis.  While Trump s specific allegation of money laundering is new, accusations of an improper relationship between the Clintons, State Department, and Laureate are not.  The connections between the three were originally published in the 2015 book  Clinton Cash  by Peter Schweizer and reported on by Bloomberg and Inside Higher Education.  At the time, Laureate denied the accusations, and said that IYF was an independent non-profit organization; not an affiliate of Laureate. Trump contrasted Clinton s troubled ties to Laureate Education with his own Trump University, where the email said the candidate  has created an incredible learning experience for students.   Like Trump University, Laureate was the subject of a class-action fraud lawsuit, although that case was later dismissed.                  I think historically, not just this year, delegates are and should be able to vote the way they see fit, Scott Walker said.   Wisconsin Gov.  Scott Walker said Tuesday that delegates to next month's Republican National Convention in Cleveland should  vote the way they see fit,  which could mean not necessarily supporting presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate and delegate to the convention, said he would cast his ballot in the first round for Ted Cruz, as the Texas senator won the Wisconsin primary, according to a report from The Associated Press. Referring to remarks from Paul Ryan on NBC's Meet the Press in which the speaker of the House remarked that he would not ask fellow party members to violate their conscience by supporting Trump, Walker said the Wisconsin Republican lawmaker's comments are legitimate. I think historically, not just this year, delegates are and should be able to vote the way they see fit, Walker said, according to the AP.  We'll see how things go between now and the convention as to what the next steps are.  I'm not going to speculate now only because you all know the situation may change by this afternoon, let alone between now and the convention. Walker has said he would support Trump as the presumptive nominee, but has called for him to rescind and clarify his comments regarding the judge involved in the lawsuit over Trump University.  Trump questioned Judge Gonzalo Curiel s ability to preside over the case because of his Mexican heritage.  Walker said he is still looking for clarity from Trump.                   All of the money she is raising is blood money,  Donald Trump said Tuesday.    AP PhotoDonald Trump says there s a specific type of funding supporting Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign:  Blood money.   The presumptive Republican nominee suggested that he is in strong financial shape to secure the presidency in an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell set to air Wednesday morning, while criticizing the former secretary of state s campaign contributions.   She has $42 million in the bank, you've got a million in the bank.  How do you run a ground campaign?  O Donnell asked Trump about the discrepancy between the two presumptive nominees' campaign funding. Trump asserted that Clinton s campaign money was raised over a short period of time.   It only took into account one day,  he said.  Pressed further, the Manhattan billionaire defended his own campaign finance strategy, which has primarily been absent of robust fundraising efforts.   You know when she raises this money, every time she raises this money, she is making deals.  Saying:  Can I be the ambassador to this? Can I do that? Make sure my business is being taken care of.   I mean, gimme a break   all of the money she is raising is blood money,  he said, adding that Clinton has accepted  tremendous amounts  of money from Wall Street, a criticism that has dogged her throughout her candidacy.  Trump also criticized Clinton s foreign policy while serving as President Barack Obama's secretary of state.   What China did to this country it was pillage.  They pillaged this country.  They did things to us, to us with trade deficits that were unbelievable and part of that comes out of the secretary of state,  he said.

Donald Trump s campaign started the month with a paltry $1. 3 million in cash   a mere fraction of Hillary Clinton's $42. 5 million war chest   putting the GOP front-runner at a sharp disadvantage heading into the general election against Clinton s money machine.  On the same day that Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, amid a steady stream of reports of campaign infighting and disorganization, the latest batch of Federal Election Commission filings show that the real estate mogul has a long way to go to establish a financial operation that can compete at the national level.  And it s not just money   the filings revealed a campaign staff of less than 70, a number dwarfed by Clinton s nearly 700 paid employees, and few of the campaign s expenses suggested work had begun to build out a more robust operation.  All together, it s the most lopsided fundraising start to a presidential election in the modern campaign finance era. The filings detail campaign finances covering the month of May, during which Trump locked up the GOP nomination after the May 3 Indiana primary.  Republicans had hoped that Trump s clearing of the field would prompt their donors to rally behind their presumptive nominee and allow him to close the gap with Clinton s campaign, which was still struggling to finish off primary rival Bernie Sanders. Instead, the campaign showed no clear path for improving its financial picture.  Trump raised just $3. 1 million from donors (including almost $2 million in amounts less than $200) and lent his campaign $2. 2 million, though he said he won t continue self-funding through the general election.  Trump has now loaned his campaign a total of $45. 7 million, almost exactly the same amount that Mitt Romney loaned his 2008 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.  Unlike Romney, who mostly downplayed his wealth, Trump s boasts about his wealth and his willingness to self-finance his campaign were a central part of his message during the primary.  Trump castigated his primary opponents for being beholden to big donors and called out the donors as puppet masters.  So when Trump decided that he would seek to raise outside money for his own election, the reversal was awkward, not least because he had failed to assemble a finance operation for his skeletal campaign. On the bright side, Trump's campaign trimmed spending from $9. 4 million in April to $6. 7 million in May.  But with so little money in the bank, frugality alone won't make the operation more competitive.  Even the defunct campaigns of Ted Cruz and Ben Carson had more cash on hand than Trump s.  In fact, several House members running for reelection have more cash on hand than Trump s campaign.  Peter King (R-N. Y. ) had $3 million, Joe Kennedy (D-Mass. ) reported $2. 2 million, Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N. Y. ) and Lee Zeldin (R-N. Y. ) each reported about $1. 8 million, and Mike Coffman (R-Colo. ) had $1. 4 million.  Comparing cash figures was always a little spurious in the primaries, with Trump poised to pump more money into his own campaign (despite conflicting accounts of his actual wealth and liquidity).  But he has made clear he won t bankroll his bid through November, and he s still a long way from the $300 million his backers say they hope to raise   already a retreat from Trump's original $1 billion goal.  Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign and its allied super PAC have already amassed more than $300 million. The May FEC report showed just 69 people on payroll, to Clinton s 685.  And the Trump campaign s spending offered no signs that it is building a national campaign infrastructure.  The biggest expenditures included $350,000 for the use of Trump s private jet; $493,000 to rent Trump facilities such as Mar-A-Lago, the Trump winery and two of his golf clubs; and $208,000 on hats. By comparison, the campaign spent only $48,000 on data management and $115,000 on online advertising. The campaign, which has been hounded by sometimes violent protests and disruptions, paid the Secret Service $179,000 and $59,000 to private security company XMark. One sign of a fledgling fundraising operation was $3 million raised for the Republican National Committee through Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee formed late in the month. The campaign spent just $227,500 on direct mail, $150,000 on placed media and $80,000 on online advertising, according to the FEC filing. The Trump campaign has yet to reserve any air time for advertising in the fall, and he might not be able to rely on super PACs.  The real estate mogul s inflammatory attacks on a federal judge and renewed calls for a ban on Muslim immigration have failed to endear him to the party s leading donors, and one of the main outside groups supporting him, Great America PAC, raised just $1. 4 million in May.                  Donald Trump said he could put up an unlimited amount of his own money if he had to.   Donald Trump defended his campaign's meager war chest on Tuesday, boasting that he could put up his own money in order to defeat Hillary Clinton if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign at this point.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Monday's Federal Election Commission filings showed Clinton with more than $42 million on hand by the end of May, while Trump had $1. 3 million, less than some congressional and gubernatorial candidates. In its statement, the campaign asserted that June is the first month of fundraising activity outside of Trump's self-funding and that that will be reflected in the report to be filed next month.  The campaign also pointed to the fact that Trump did not hold any official fundraising events until May 25, when the presumptive Republican nominee hosted a $25,000-per-ticket dinner at the California home of real estate investor Thomas Barrack. To date, the campaign s fundraising has been incredible and we continue to see a tremendous outpouring of support for Mr.  Trump and money to the Republican Party.  The positive response to our fundraising efforts so far is a further indication that the country does not want yet another corrupt politician like Crooked Hillary, the campaign said.                  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at the Trump Tower on May 31, in New York.    Donald Trump, who as a primary candidate prided himself on being a self-funder, on Tuesday blasted out his first personal fundraising solicitation hours after his campaign's finance report showed him with a fraction of the cash on hand as Hillary Clinton. This is the first fundraising email I have ever sent on behalf of my campaign.  That s right.  The FIRST ONE, Trump wrote in the email, with the last two words underlined.  Even though his first fundraising email comes more than a year after he launched his campaign, the presumptive Republican nominee vowed to help make it the most successful introductory fundraising email in modern political history by personally matching every dollar that comes in WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS, up to $2 million!The latest batch of Federal Election Commission filings show a dismal state of affairs for Trump, who has just $1. 3 million cash on hand compared to more than $42 million in Clinton's warchest.  And while Trump has touted his skeleton staff as a model of efficiency, the latest documents show Clinton with nearly 10 times the number of employees on payroll.                  RNC spokesman Sean Spicer pushed back against reports about Donald Trump's fundraising.   AP PhotoThe Republican National Committee is pushing back against financial reports that show Donald Trump significantly trailing Hillary Clinton, saying they don t signal a struggling campaign. On Monday, financial reports showed Trump s campaign started the month of June with $1. 3 million in cash compared to Clinton s $42. 5 million.  However, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said the funds do not account for the fact that Trump has largely funded his own campaign.   That s a false narrative,  Spicer said Tuesday on CNN .   You're looking at the Trump campaign through the prism of the Hillary Clinton campaign.  Donald Trump financed his campaign all the way to this point by adding in more of his own personal money.  So it's false to say that he has $1. 3 million.  If he wanted to get that number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it's up.  Spicer added that the campaign has shifted to a  fundraising mechanism  for the general election.  If you look at the months going forward whether it's the low dollar activity that we're seeing in the mail and the phones or the people that really want to meet him at some of the in-person fund-raisers, there's tremendous intensity,  he said.   As much as I appreciate everyone's concern over our finances, when you look at it in totality year-over-year, we're doing really, really well.   Trump s meager financial report came just as the campaign was dealing with the fallout of firing campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.  He was let go Monday morning, just a month out from the Republican National Convention.  Corey Lewandowski had fought his way back from the brink of termination at least twice over the past few months, utilizing a no-holds-barred style of infighting seldom seen in presidential politics while relying on the loyalty of a small group of allies and an unusually close relationship with his boss.  But Lewandowski s survival strategy began to backfire this month.  And by the time he was called into one of the executive offices at Donald Trump s campaign headquarters in Manhattan s Trump Tower on Monday morning for the final time as campaign manager, the once-obscure GOP operative had run out of lifelines.  He d grown increasingly reckless in his power struggle, taking on the candidate s own family and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  He d already told associates more than once in the past few months that he was on the verge of quitting, and some of his allies had either backed away from him or quit the campaign.  So when Lewandowski was informed in a meeting with Trump s adult children that he was being relieved of his dream job running the first-time candidate s presidential campaign, the career GOP operative didn t argue.  Lewandowski emerged from the executive office to find security waiting, and they watched him as he packed up his things, then escorted him out of the building, according to two sources briefed on the encounter.   He didn t put up a fight because he is loyal,  said one Lewandowski associate.   The gloves had come off a while ago, and Corey spent a lot of energy fighting, which took away from the campaign.   The source said Lewandowski  was surrounded by enemies.  He was outgunned.   Lewandowski declined to comment for this story.  He told CNN he was  proud to have been a small part  of Trump s campaign but didn t know why he was fired.   Things change as the campaign evolves,  he said, denying his dismissal had anything to do with tensions with Trump s family.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump stood by the decision.  He praised Lewandowski as  a good guy  and  a friend of mine  who  did a great job,  but he said  it s time now for a different kind of a campaign.  The Trump campaign would not say whether Trump was in the room for the firing.  It denied that Lewandowski s relationship with the candidate s family had anything to do with his termination, though the family members with whom sources say he clashed most   Trump s influential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner   did not respond to requests for comment.  The RNC also didn t respond to requests for comment. But interviews with about two dozen sources, including Trump family friends and people who work in and around the campaign, traced Lewandowski s firing to longstanding issues brought to the fore this month, as Trump struggled to pivot to a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton amid increasing campaign dysfunction and declining poll numbers.  The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, led to intensifying calls from influential Republicans   including Priebus   for Trump to moderate his inflammatory rhetoric, according to campaign sources.  They said that Lewandowski s critics   chief among them campaign chairman Paul Manafort   responded by arguing that Lewandowski was actually encouraging Trump s propensity to offend.  Priebus also told campaign officials that Lewandowski had become a significant impediment to ironing out tensions between the RNC and the campaign, according to two sources familiar with the interaction.  One said Priebus ticked off a number of areas in which Lewandowski  had been a roadblock.   The source said that Priebus' criticism  undercut and hurt the campaign,  which is more reliant on the national party for basic campaign infrastructure than that of any recent nominee. And Lewandowski s critics also pinned the blame on him for unflattering media coverage of Kushner s growing behind-the-scenes role in the campaign, according to three sources familiar with internal campaign dynamics.  This month, for instance, The Associated Press profiled Kushner, citing people inside the campaign griping about his inexperience and noting his father s convictions for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness intimidation. The perception inside Trump s inner circle was that  Corey was trying to isolate Trump and cut him off from even Ivanka and Jared,  said a longtime Trump business associate who speaks to the family and its representatives regularly.   That was overstepping his bounds.  Ivanka Trump, who for months had expressed misgivings about Lewandowski s temperament and qualifications for the job, last week grew increasingly resolute in her calls for his termination, according to several people in and around the campaign and the family.  One person close to the campaign said it got  to the point where she was going to distance herself from the campaign if Corey didn t go.  By early last week, erstwhile Trump adviser Roger Stone, a Manafort ally who had pushed for months for Lewandowski s ouster, was gleefully telling associates that a coup was imminent. In some ways, Lewandowski s story is the story of the Trump campaign. The scrappy 42-year-old from the hardscrabble mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, didn t have any presidential campaign experience when he was plucked from relative obscurity to run Trump s presidential campaign prior to its June 2015 launch.  At the time, the billionaire real estate showman was regarded by the political establishment as a sideshow with little chance of making an impact in the race, let alone winning the nomination. Lewandowski quickly built a strong rapport with Trump by treating him with absolute reverence, unfailingly referring to him as  Mr.  Trump  or  Sir    even when Trump wasn t around   and encouraging him to act on his bombastic instincts.  Lewandowski also reassured the sometimes tightfisted billionaire, who initially pledged to self-fund his campaign, that it wasn t necessary to invest serious money in the traditional tools of presidential campaigning, such as polling, voter files, analytics and major advertising campaigns.  Instead, Lewandowski s approach was to hire a tiny staff composed mostly of allies from his past jobs and to  let Trump be Trump.   The result was impressive: billions of dollars  worth of free publicity generated by Trump s confrontational rhetoric at splashy campaign rallies, during television interviews and on social media.  Initially, Trump s adult children were wary of Lewandowski s unwillingness to try to temper their father s rhetoric because they were concerned that it was damaging the family s brand and corporate partnerships, said the longtime Trump business associate.  But as Trump gained traction in the polls and began winning primaries, the Trump children realized that their father actually had a chance to win and questioned whether Lewandowski was  helping take their father to the next level, because he is not getting the type of advice he needs to temper his worst impulses,  said the associate.  But Trump stuck by Lewandowski, even after he was accused of roughing up a reporter in March, rejecting calls to fire him by explaining I don't do that.  I'm loyal. By the end of the month, though, Trump had brought on Manafort, a veteran of 40 years' worth of GOP presidential campaigns.  The move, which multiple sources said came at the behest of Trump s adult children, seemed a tacit acknowledgment of the limitations of Lewandowski s approach. Manafort brought in a cadre of associates from his days as a power lobbyist, dividing the campaign into two rival camps loyal to Manafort and Lewandowski.  The camps dispensed sometimes contradictory orders to campaign staff and provided conflicting advice to Trump.  Manafort urged more spending on advertising and hiring, while Lewandowski pushed back, vetoing at least two proposed Manafort hires. In an April meeting at Trump Tower, Trump deputized Manafort to reorganize the campaign and to take the reins, as first reported by POLITICO.  A top Lewandowski ally on the campaign named Stuart Jolly immediately tendered his resignation.  Lewandowski went home to his family in New Hampshire and privately told associates he intended to quit imminently as well, but Trump personally asked him to return, according to two campaign sources.  When he reappeared at Trump Tower, the infighting intensified to a degree unusual even in the alpha-dominated world of presidential politics, according to a handful of campaign insiders.  They describe a campaign in which the senior officials and their allies spent as much or more time waging internecine warfare as they did on campaign strategy. Manafort s allies circulated rumors about Lewandowski s personal life and had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a New York tabloid, according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to be.  Lewandowski s supporters, in turn, have urged Trump and his representatives to examine Manafort s personal life as well as the lobbying done by Manafort and his associates for controversial clients around the world, according to people on both sides of the Lewandowski-Manafort rift.  And according to two campaign sources, Lewandowski highlighted for Trump instances in which Manafort had been quoted telling ostensibly private audiences that the candidate intended to tone down his rhetoric in the general election.  Those reports deeply bothered Trump, who prided himself on rejecting political norms dictating that candidates speak from a script and avoid making provocative remarks. Manafort didn't respond to a request for comment. Late last month, Lewandowski successfully pushed Trump to fire one of Manafort s first major hires, political director Rick Wiley.  And he jealously guarded his access to the candidate, making sure that either he or an ally   usually communications director Hope Hicks   were at Trump s side at all times.  On plane rides, Lewandowski and Hicks would trade off Trump-watch duties, taking turns sitting next to him when one or the other needed to go to the bathroom, according to a source who witnessed the arrangement. But in recent days, Trump has increasingly seemed to come to grips with the need to expand his campaign and tone down his rhetoric, telling donors at a private fundraiser in Arizona on Saturday that he was preparing to pivot to the general election, according to a donor who was present.  Lewandowski accompanied Trump to the fundraiser, at the Goldwater House, where he was seen pacing back and forth with anxious energy, which is not at all unusual for the Red Bull-chugging operative.  In fact, the decision seems to have surprised Lewandowski and his allies in and around the campaign. One campaign official said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss.  It was  a good chat,  the official said. Eli Stokols contributed to this report.  Corey Lewandowski had fought his way back from the brink of termination at least twice over the past few months, utilizing a no-holds-barred style of infighting seldom seen in presidential politics while relying on the loyalty of a small group of allies and an unusually close relationship with his boss.  But Lewandowski s survival strategy began to backfire this month.  And by the time he was called into one of the executive offices at Donald Trump s campaign headquarters in Manhattan s Trump Tower on Monday morning for the final time as campaign manager, the once-obscure GOP operative had run out of lifelines.  He d grown increasingly reckless in his power struggle, taking on the candidate s own family and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  He d already told associates more than once in the past few months that he was on the verge of quitting, and some of his allies had either backed away from him or quit the campaign.  So when Lewandowski was informed in a meeting with Trump s adult children that he was being relieved of his dream job running the first-time candidate s presidential campaign, the career GOP operative didn t argue.  Lewandowski emerged from the executive office to find security waiting, and they watched him as he packed up his things, then escorted him out of the building, according to two sources briefed on the encounter.   He didn t put up a fight because he is loyal,  said one Lewandowski associate.   The gloves had come off a while ago, and Corey spent a lot of energy fighting, which took away from the campaign.   The source said Lewandowski  was surrounded by enemies.  He was outgunned.   Lewandowski declined to comment for this story.  He told CNN he was  proud to have been a small part  of Trump s campaign but didn t know why he was fired.   Things change as the campaign evolves,  he said, denying his dismissal had anything to do with tensions with Trump s family.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump stood by the decision.  He praised Lewandowski as  a good guy  and  a friend of mine  who  did a great job,  but he said  it s time now for a different kind of a campaign.  The Trump campaign would not say whether Trump was in the room for the firing.  It denied that Lewandowski s relationship with the candidate s family had anything to do with his termination, though the family members with whom sources say he clashed most   Trump s influential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner   did not respond to requests for comment.  The RNC also didn t respond to requests for comment. But interviews with about two dozen sources, including Trump family friends and people who work in and around the campaign, traced Lewandowski s firing to longstanding issues brought to the fore this month, as Trump struggled to pivot to a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton amid increasing campaign dysfunction and declining poll numbers.  The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, led to intensifying calls from influential Republicans   including Priebus   for Trump to moderate his inflammatory rhetoric, according to campaign sources.  They said that Lewandowski s critics   chief among them campaign chairman Paul Manafort   responded by arguing that Lewandowski was actually encouraging Trump s propensity to offend.  Priebus also told campaign officials that Lewandowski had become a significant impediment to ironing out tensions between the RNC and the campaign, according to two sources familiar with the interaction.  One said Priebus ticked off a number of areas in which Lewandowski  had been a roadblock.   The source said that Priebus' criticism  undercut and hurt the campaign,  which is more reliant on the national party for basic campaign infrastructure than that of any recent nominee.

It was  a good chat,  the official said. Eli Stokols contributed to this report.                  Valerie Jarrett speaks on a stage at the White House Summit on the United State of Women on June 14.   Valerie Jarrett is increasingly asserting control of the administration s campaign to curtail gun violence   and she s not afraid of burning White House bridges with firearm manufacturers as she does it. Even before the latest massacre in Orlando, it was Jarrett who used her influence with President Barack Obama to resurrect the push for new regulations, gun control advocates say.  But since that shooting, she s employed a more aggressive strategy than did Vice President Joe Biden, whose consensus-building efforts failed to produce new laws three years ago. Take a recent White House bid to collaborate with weapons manufactures on so-called  smart guns,  which make it impossible for anyone other than an authorized user to fire a weapon   and should be fertile ground for a relatively non-controversial compromise. But after 30 industry executives refused to show up for a meeting last Friday, Jarrett decided to mobilize nearly 200,000 supporters behind a new assault weapons ban, which industry vehemently opposes and would take a bestseller off the shelves.  While it didn t slam the door on further negotiations, it s the kind of move that would make any future talks much more difficult. With Biden dispatched in search of a cure for cancer, and Obama demanding an end to the bloodshed, Jarrett   Obama's closest friend and conscience in the West Wing   is not just focused on measures like background checks that are much easier to sell to Congress, at least compared to an assault weapons ban.  Instead, Jarrett is executing Obama s call to  politicize  the issue during his last year in office and crank up the pressure on reluctant lawmakers.  Please keep making your voices heard.  Raise them over and over and over and over and over again,  Jarrett said on Monday in an unusual conference call, which was intended for the people who signed a  We the People  petition to ban the AR-15, but was broadcast live on YouTube for anyone to listen.  I ve had people say to me,  Well I enjoy gong to the firing range and using the assault weapons,   Jarrett said.   But the pleasure derived from that compared to the horrendous damage that it can do, we believe that the damage warrants banning assault weapons.  In the wake of the Orlando massacre, which involved a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, both Obama and Biden have made clear that, as Biden put it in his written response to the AR-15 petition, assault weapons  should be banned from civilian ownership.   But Biden focused his message to Congress on passing the background check and terror watch list bills that failed in the Senate on Monday. Jarrett went further:  There s no reason why Congress could not reauthorize legislation that would call for that ban.   And stoking support for the assault weapons ban with activists will likely intensify the political fight ahead of the 2016 elections. Previously, Obama put Biden in charge of crafting the administration s response to the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shootings, and the vice president still serves a prominent role as sympathizer-in-chief.  But since his effort ran aground, gun control advocates say, it s been Jarrett who s pushed for action over the last year despite congressional gridlock.  As the months went by and ideas were discussed and priorities came and went, she was a constant source of influence in the building making sure that the process was moving forward,  said Peter Ambler, director at Americans for Responsible Solutions.  When the group s co-founders, former Rep.  Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, proposed new executive actions during a January 2015 meeting with Obama and Jarrett in Phoenix, Ambler recalled, the president turned to his senior adviser to make them happen.  He announced new directives to expand background checks a year later.   I don t think that there is an individual at the White House except for the president who can claim more responsibility for the successes of the executive actions than Valerie Jarrett,  Ambler said. Biden isn t completely out of the picture, though he's increasingly turned his attention to his  Cancer Moonshot.   As the architect of the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban and original background check bill, he s got substantial credibility with activists, especially those driven by grief.  I refuse to give up, we refuse to give up,  Biden said on Wednesday at a Washington fundraiser for Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention group founded by parents of the first-graders gunned down at the elementary school.  It took me seven years to get the first ban put in place,  said Biden, who had argued that the administration should prioritize guns even before the Newtown shooting.   We should not stop.  But as the audience waited for Biden to come to the podium, Jarrett was in the back of the room, deep in conversation, as her top aides   Paulette Aniskoff, Bess Evans and Yohannes Abraham   circulated through the crowd.  It was those aides, in Jarrett s Office of Public Engagement, who have gradually taken on the bulk of the gun portfolio over the past three years, even as they continue to collaborate with Biden s staff. The portfolio has been something of an orphan in the Obama administration, with no obvious point person, particularly after the legislation Biden was working on failed in April 2013, and Bruce Reed, who had run an exhaustive series of outreach and strategy sessions with gun control advocates in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, stepped down as Biden s chief of staff in late 2013. Jarrett brought it back into the West Wing   and out to the statehouses, advocates said, by making it a priority for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.  In May, for example, Jarrett presided over a White House strategy session on enacting local laws to expand background checks and promote gun safety technology with elected officials from 48 states. In his search for progress after Newtown, Biden and his staff famously met with, as he put it,  every possible stakeholder in this debate; 229 separate groups,  in just a few months.  They settled on expanding background checks, a measure that s hovered above 80 percent public approval since 2013.  The bill failed in the Senate then, and an updated version failed on Monday, 56 to 44. Meeting with  stakeholders  is also a raison d etre of Jarrett s office.  Part of the Valerie Jarrett portfolio is working with the many constituencies that have a stake in the issues that matter most, and one of those has become the family members of victims of shootings,  said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on gun policy. Jarrett herself is in that category: she s recounted how her grandfather was killed with his own gun when burglars broke into his office. She was trying the outreach approach before a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, when her focus was on smart guns.  The administration is working to get buy-in from police for the technology, in hopes of creating a new market; earlier this month, the Department of Justice hosted law enforcement officials to talk about how smart guns might work for their departments. Manufacturers have expressed some openness to smart guns   they could be a whole new sales category, after all   but they fear any sort of government mandate, as well as backlash from gun rights groups. So weeks before the Orlando shooting, Jarrett and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough invited executives from about 30 gun-makers to the White House.  They declined, according to an industry executive, because they perceived the invitation as  disingenuous.    Jarrett lashed out at the gun lobby in her call.  The NRA over the past seven and a half years has never been willing to come to the table and work with us,  she said.  (Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.

Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn and Xavier Becerra take questions during a news conference at the Capitol on May 11.   House Democrats are trying to force a vote on several gun control measures, but are being shut down by the GOP majority. For the second time in two weeks, Rep.  James Clyburn (S. C. ) sought to be recognized on the House floor Tuesday night so he could bring up two gun-related bills on expanded background checks and the so-called No fly, no buy proposal.  That measure states that anyone on the FBI's No Fly list cannot purchase a gun. But Republicans refused to allow Clyburn to move forward.  Democrats began yelling No bill, no break!   meaning they want to cancel the July congressional recess   although their outburst ended after a couple minutes. The episode shows how little power the minority has in the House of Representatives, but also points to the fact that Clyburn, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif. ) and other Democrats aren't dropping the issue any time soon. With the nation still stunned by the bloody June 12 shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead and another 53 wounded   the worst mass shooting in U. S.  history   Democrats on Capitol Hill have responded by forcing   or in the case of House Democrats, attempting to do so   votes on several gun-related bills they say have broad support with the American public. Senate Democrats, led by Sens.  Chris Murphy (Conn. ) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif. ), failed to get the support they needed to move forward on the proposals in a Monday night showdown, although more gun votes will take place in that chamber later this week. House Democrats, for their part, have no such leverage to force votes, except by putting enough political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) and other Republicans to goad them into taking action.  Clyburn, Pelosi and other Democrats hope the theatrics on the House floor   a respected senior Democratic lawmaker seeking recognition only to be ignored by Republicans   highlights GOP intransigence on the issue. Pelosi has been strongly pushing the No fly, no buy provision, pointing to the fact that it has broad public support in polls.  The California Democrat is now employing a No bill, no break line to urge Ryan to postpone the July 15 recess unless the House passes the No fly, no buy bill. Every day, there is going to be more and more pressure on Ryan to give us a vote, or send us home without a vote, said Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ), who is in charge of messaging for House Democrats.  So far, they're dug in, so we're going to use every strategy and tactic we have to either punish them from being dug in or help them pick their feet off the ground. While some progressive Democrats want their leadership to advocate a vote on assault weapons ban, Pelosi and other top Democrats argue that there is not sufficient backing to do that at this time.                  Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn and Xavier Becerra take questions during a news conference at the Capitol on May 11.   House Democrats are trying to force a vote on several gun control measures, but are being shut down by the GOP majority. For the second time in two weeks, Rep.  James Clyburn (S. C. ) sought to be recognized on the House floor Tuesday night so he could bring up two gun-related bills on expanded background checks and the so-called No fly, no buy proposal.  That measure states that anyone on the FBI's No Fly list cannot purchase a gun. But Republicans refused to allow Clyburn to move forward.  Democrats began yelling No bill, no break!   meaning they want to cancel the July congressional recess   although their outburst ended after a couple minutes. The episode shows how little power the minority has in the House of Representatives, but also points to the fact that Clyburn, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif. ) and other Democrats aren't dropping the issue any time soon. With the nation still stunned by the bloody June 12 shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead and another 53 wounded   the worst mass shooting in U. S.  history   Democrats on Capitol Hill have responded by forcing   or in the case of House Democrats, attempting to do so   votes on several gun-related bills they say have broad support with the American public. Senate Democrats, led by Sens.  Chris Murphy (Conn. ) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif. ), failed to get the support they needed to move forward on the proposals in a Monday night showdown, although more gun votes will take place in that chamber later this week. House Democrats, for their part, have no such leverage to force votes, except by putting enough political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) and other Republicans to goad them into taking action.  Clyburn, Pelosi and other Democrats hope the theatrics on the House floor   a respected senior Democratic lawmaker seeking recognition only to be ignored by Republicans   highlights GOP intransigence on the issue. Pelosi has been strongly pushing the No fly, no buy provision, pointing to the fact that it has broad public support in polls.  The California Democrat is now employing a No bill, no break line to urge Ryan to postpone the July 15 recess unless the House passes the No fly, no buy bill.

While some progressive Democrats want their leadership to advocate a vote on assault weapons ban, Pelosi and other top Democrats argue that there is not sufficient backing to do that at this time.  Senate GOP leaders are eyeing a vote as early as Thursday on a compromise proposal to bar people with terrorist ties from purchasing firearms, which would tee up yet another floor fight over gun policy just days after the chamber rejected four measures on the issue.  The plan, written by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) and a handful of deal-making senators, is still expected to draw notable Republican opposition because of how it's drafted.  Under her bill, someone who is unable to buy a gun gets to appeal that decision only after he or she has already been denied the purchase   a deal-breaker for many GOP lawmakers. Indeed, the National Rifle Association issued a statement Tuesday afternoon dismissing the bill   effectively ensuring that a flood of GOP lawmakers will oppose it.   Keeping guns from terrorists while protecting the due process rights of law-abiding citizens are not mutually exclusive,  said Chris Cox, the executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.   Unfortunately, Senator Collins and others are focusing their efforts on unconstitutional proposals that would not have prevented the Orlando terrorist attack.  One influential Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), said he could not support Collins  bill as written due to  concerns about the lack of due process on the front end.    But I m happy to work with them so we can move this to a place where we get the largest number of people,  said Cornyn, who said the chamber will vote on the measure on Thursday.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) said the measure would get a vote, but declined to commit to a firm date.  Still, Republican leaders aren t twisting arms on the vote, allowing members to vote their conscience. Democrats and Republican leaders were mostly non-committal on the emerging bipartisan proposal, with Cornyn highlighting Second Amendment concerns and Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N. Y. ) questioning why the bill isn t broader.  The likely Democratic leader in the next Congress said the bill is a  step in the right direction,  but then highlighted why it will be so difficult for Republicans to support: He proposed calling it the  Buck the NRA  bill.  Neither McConnell nor Minority Leader Harry Reid said whether they will support the legislation. A group of Republicans looking to strike a deal and several senators up for reelection met privately Tuesday morning with McConnell, Cornyn and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune Tuesday morning.  Sens.  Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire are joining Collins in pushing the compromise, along with centrist Democratic Caucus members like Sens.  Heidi Heitkamp (D-N. D. ) and Angus King (I-Maine).  Collins, Ayotte and Flake met with GOP leaders along with Republican Sens.  Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to gauge the prospects of the legislation. I've looked at every proposal, Rubio said as he headed into the meeting Tuesday.  If there is a way to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, I'm open to it. The Collins-led bill would prevent people on the no-fly list and the Secondary Security Screening Selectee list, which prompts extra security scrutiny at airports, from buying guns with an appeals process.  People who are on the broader terrorism watch list or have been within the past five years would be able to purchase firearms without being blocked, but the FBI would be notified.   Our goal is simple and straightforward: we want to make America safer,  Collins said at a news conference announcing her compromise.   All of us are united in our desire to getting something significant done on this vital issue.   Democrats also discussed the matter at a party lunch, where Heitkamp made the pitch to her colleagues on why they should embrace the Collins compromise.  Some Senate Democrats such as Bill Nelson of Florida, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico are supporting the compromise.  For her part, Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ) said Tuesday afternoon that she wanted to meet with Collins to flesh out some provisions in the Maine senator s bill that Feinstein wanted clarified.  Clearing the 60-vote threshold may be difficult with the election just under five months away and several Senate Republicans running tough reelection bids.  Collins  measure shares many of the same features as Feinstein s bill, which garnered 47 votes in favor on Monday night.  Portman said he was evaluating the Collins  plan but did not make commitments one way or the other.  Toomey, meanwhile, issued a statement Tuesday saying he would support it.  Other Republicans urged their GOP colleagues to back the compromise   and had tough words for the gun lobby.   To my friends at the NRA, I understand your concern about denying somebody the right to buy a gun, that s a constitutional right,  said Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ), who also supports the Collins measure.   But every right, whether it s speech or buying a weapon or any other constitutional right, has boundaries on it.

C. ), who also supports the Collins measure.   But every right, whether it s speech or buying a weapon or any other constitutional right, has boundaries on it.   Just as Donald Trump shouldn t have his finger on the nuclear button, the real estate mogul shouldn t have his hands on America s economy, Hillary Clinton said Tuesday, warning that Trump would drive the U. S.  economy into a recession, default on the national debt and give the biggest tax breaks to the highest earners.  A few weeks ago, I said his foreign policy proposals and reckless statements represent a danger to our national security.  But you might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman he would be better prepared to handle the economy,  Clinton said Tuesday in a speech on the economy she delivered in Columbus, Ohio.  Well, it turns out he s dangerous there, too,  she said.   Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  Clinton said her views of Trump s economic policies aren t just the typical partisan clash.   Liberals and conservatives say Trump s ideas would be disastrous,  she said.   The Chamber of Commerce and labor unions.  Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren.  Economists on the right and the left and the center all agree: Trump would throw us back into recession.  The former secretary of state praised President Barack Obama and his leadership in shepherding the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis but stressed that a Trump administration would take America back to that time by loosening Wall Street regulations that were enacted to prevent another crisis. She also blasted the businessman for his willingness to gamble with the faith and credit of the U. S.  by suggesting he would allow America to default on its debt.  That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,  Clinton said.   Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.  You see, we pay our debts.  But she didn t stop there.  She highlighted Trump s bombastic rhetoric and gaffes on everything from claiming that wages were too high to hoping the housing market would crash to saying America couldn t default on its debt because it prints its own money.  And finally, the Trump campaign said that if worst came to worst, we could just sell off America s assets,  Clinton added.   Really? Even if we sold all of our aircraft carriers and the Statue of Liberty, even if we let some billionaire turn Yosemite into a private country club, we still wouldn't even get close.  That's how much debt he d run up.  Maybe this is what he means when he says  I love playing with debt.   Someone should tell him our nation s economy isn t a game.   Clinton slammed Trump s immigration policies, ripping his  wrong-headed and unachievable  plan to deport some 11 million undocumented immigrants as  really bad economics.   Kicking out 11 million immigrants would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and it would shrink our economy significantly,  she said.   Some economists actually argue that just this policy alone would send us into a Trump recession.  So instead of causing large-scale misery and shrinking our economy, we should pass sensible immigration reform with a path to citizenship.  She also ridiculed Trump and his  America First  policy, especially given that many of his branded products are produced overseas.  Interestingly, Trump s own products are made in a lot of countries that aren t named America: Trump Ties are made in China, Trump Suits in Mexico, Trump Furniture in Turkey, Trump Picture Frames in India, Trump Barware in Slovenia, and I could go on and on, but you get the idea,  she said.   And I d love for him to explain how all of that fits with his talk about  America First.   And she needled the reality star for refusing to disclose his tax returns, insisting that his reluctance to do so shows that he either doesn t pay his fair share in taxes, isn t as rich as he claims to be or doesn t donate as much money to charity as he says he does.  You have to ask yourself, what s he afraid of?  Clinton asked.   Whatever the reason, Americans deserve to know before you cast your votes this November.   Trump has boasted that his business acumen would make him a good president, arguing that he would do for America what he s done for his businesses.  But Clinton mocked him for that, too.  He s written a lot of books about business.  They all seem to end at Chapter 11,  Clinton said in an implicit shot at Trump s bankruptcies.   Go figure.  Clinton accused Trump of intentionally running up companies' debt and defaulting, burdening workers, small businesses and shareholders while Trump emerged unscathed.  Everything seems to be a game with him.  Well, it isn t for a lot of us, is it?  Clinton said.  Now he s trying to say he s changed   somebody s told him he needs to say that   that he s not in it for himself anymore, he s really now in it for America,  she continued.   But he s doing the exact same thing that he s been doing for years.  This is his one move: He makes over-the-top promises that if people stick with him, trust him, listen to him, put their faith in him, he ll deliver for them, he ll make them wildly successful and then everything falls apart and then people get hurt.  Clinton s speech comes on the heels of a Moody s Analytics analysis released Monday that determined that a Trump presidency would  significantly  weaken the economy, driving the U. S.  into a  lengthy  recession with nearly 3. 5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate.  Clinton sought to use that report to her advantage on Tuesday. Chief economist Mark Zandi, the lead author of the analysis, is a former John McCain adviser who donated to Clinton s primary campaign last year.  Clinton herself pointed to Zandi's Republican ties to buttress her argument that Democrats are not the only ones who have expressed alarm. Trump s rapid response team sought to discredit the report, blasting out emails to reporters calling Zandi an Obama adviser and Clinton donor.  A separate email highlighted the falling income and increased poverty and entitlement spending under the Obama administration, while another boasted that Trump s economic policies would create millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth. Another email tore into Clinton s advocacy of the Iranian nuclear deal, highlighting Boeing's agreement Tuesday to sell aircraft to IranAir, the Islamic republic's largest airline. Additional emails hit Clinton on her role in the loss of more than a quarter of American manufacturing jobs dating back to 1993, when former President Bill Clinton signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalized trade relations with China; accused the Clintons of laundering money through Bill s for-profit Laureate Education and touted Trump s eponymous yet defunct  university.  Clinton asked Americans to imagine Trump in the Oval Office the next time the country faces a crisis    if you can,  she said.  Imagine him being in charge when your jobs and savings are at stake.  Is this who you want to lead us in an emergency?  she asked.   Someone thin-skinned and quick to anger? Who d likely be on Twitter attacking reporters or bringing the whole regulatory system down on his critics when he should be focused on fixing what s wrong? Would he even know what to do?  She framed a Trump presidency as a step back for America, arguing that he would undo much of the progress the country has made under Obama and put the economy at risk.  Donald Trump believes in the worst of us.  He thinks we re fearful, not confident; that we favor division, not unity; walls, not bridges; and yesterday, not tomorrow,  she said.   He thinks the only way forward is to go back, to a past prosperity that left a lot of people out.  In fact, the only way forward is forward toward a 21st century version of the American dream with a modern economy and a shared prosperity where no one s left out or left behind.    Democratic operatives planning next month s national convention in Philadelphia have reached out to Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award-winning writer and star of the hit Broadway musical  Hamilton,  about performing at the Wells Fargo Center, sources told POLITICO. It s part of an ambitious plan to generate excitement and boost television viewership for the party convention after what Democrats expect to be a four-day reality show at the Republican convention in Cleveland. Miranda s name currently tops a lineup of A-list stars, including well-known young pop artists whomClinton campaign and Democratic National Committee officials are reaching out to as convention program planning gets underway, according to Democrats familiar with the process. Miranda   who free-styled in the Rose Garden earlier this year with President Barack Obama and whose show is now selling tickets for as much as $10,000 a pop   is proving a tough get even for Clinton.  The star performer and composer, who last week announced he will leave his Broadway production July 9, is scheduled to be in London filming a Disney remake of  Mary Poppins  the week of the Democratic convention. His father, Luis Miranda Jr. , a major player in New York Democratic politics, said,  There is no truth to these rumors  about his son s potential star turn at the convention.  A spokesman for the Clinton campaign and a spokesman for the DNC declined to comment. But the push for Miranda, as well as other A-listers with a point of view, is a sign that Clinton operatives are seeking to engage core Democratic groups like young voters, African-Americans and Latinos, with headliners other than the expected roster of gray-haired politicians.  The nights are three-hour prime-time TV shows,  said PR executive Ken Sunshine, a Clinton fundraiser with deep ties to the entertainment world.   Entertainment and adding excitement become a key part of it, as opposed to hard-core politics.  The one that understands that is Trump, except that s all he seems to understand.  Unlike the GOP   where party leaders like Mitt Romney, Sen.  John McCain and the entire Bush family have all said they plan to sit out the convention   Democrats have a deep bench of political heavyweights to choose from as headliners.  Obama is expected to speak, playing the role of the highest-profile  convert  to Clinton, giving skeptical progressives and independents license to support his former rival. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton s still-to-be-selected running mate are also expected to have prime-time slots.  First lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden could also make the case for Clinton, and Bernie Sanders is expected to deliver a prime-time speech if he concedes before July 25. The ultimate goal of the convention, according to operatives involved in the planning, is to produce a  coming together  moment that unites the party against Trump. But second to party unity is the goal of producing some memorable, watchable moments that will encourage core Democratic demos to tune in to the live cable coverage of the four-day convention   and share it broadly across social media. Unlike the 2008 convention in Denver, at which Democrats nominated Obama on a mandate of hope and change and needed to introduce him on the biggest stage of his political life, Clinton, for many Democratic voters, feels like a known commodity.  She s an establishment politician with high unfavorable ratings, who has spoken at every Democratic convention for the past two decades and struggled over the past year to generate enthusiasm for her campaign. With back-to-back conventions   Trump s nominating convention in Cleveland is July 18-21, followed by Clinton s convention in Philadelphia July 25-28   some Democrats feel a need to create additional experiences around the nominee that can energize voters. Going second is considered an advantage   it gives Democrats the last word.  And Clinton campaign insiders said much of what takes place in Philadelphia will be in reaction to the Republican convention, making contrasts with Trump a key consideration throughout the four days.  The campaign will also have a  counter convention  presence in Cleveland, headed up by deputy communications director Christina Reynolds, sources said.  Clinton s campaign would not say how many rapid response operatives it plans to send to Cleveland. But following   and countering   an unconventional candidate like Trump also raises the entertainment stakes in Philadelphia.  In Cleveland, Trump plans to flout tradition by possibly taking the stage every night himself, and announcing his running mate live on prime-time television.  He's a political Kardashian,  said Democratic strategist Tommy Vietor, a former aide to Obama.   His campaign has been the longest, grossest sex tape ever released.  Some Democrats involved with the campaign worry that without big, out-of-the-box  moments,  Trump coverage   even if it s negative   will spill over into Clinton s big week.  And while Clinton seems to have found her footing attacking an opponent whose bare-bones campaign appears to be in free fall, her campaign still needs to put out a clear and positive message about the Democratic nominee.  Entertaining acts can accentuate that, said Clinton allies.  Good entertainment doesn t have to appeal to the lowest level of expression,  said Sunshine.   Great art and humor can be inspirational, uplifting, can celebrate our diversity instead of cheap laughs at the expense of other Americans.  Clinton has no shortage of celebrities to choose from.  Pop stars like Katy Perry, Demi Lovato and Christina Aguilera have performed at fundraisers and campaign rallies.  Perry, who performed at a Clinton rally in Des Moines ahead of last year s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa, was so enthralled with the campaign, operatives said, that she requested a meeting with Clinton s policy advisers and then sat through the hours-long rubber chicken dinner listening to speeches by local elected officials. Beyonc  has also attended a Clinton fundraiser.  Hollywood power brokers like Steven Spielberg, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Rob Reiner are all backing Clinton.  Oprah Winfrey announced her endorsement last week.  And comedians like Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham have acted as stalwart campaign surrogates.  They won t have a lack of entertainment,  said a close Clinton ally. But some veterans of conventions past warn about relying too heavily on getting a lift from bold-faced names, pointing to the Republicans  failed Clint Eastwood strategy from 2012, when the actor delivered a widely mocked surprise speech at the Tampa convention, addressing an empty chair.  You certainly want to do things that would draw eyes,  said Democratic strategist and former Obama aide Ben LaBolt.   The risk of doing something outrageous is Clint Eastwood under a different name.  That was the Republican thinking heading into the last one, and they way overshot the runway and landed on the moon.  Of any entertainment ideas, he said,  It s got to serve the core message.  Outsourcing the convention to Clint Eastwood is not a good idea.  Added Brent Colburn, Obama s 2012 convention communications director:  You could have the entire cast of  Hamilton  singing the entire four days, but you have to ask yourself what that gets you besides really great television.  Ratings aren t the measure of success, votes are.  Other Clinton allies are feeling confident as the former secretary of state appears to be hitting her stride while Trump blunders through one of the worst months of any campaign.  For them, the key to the convention is to take few chances and avoid screwing up.  Democrats don t have to focus on being entertaining,  Clinton fundraiser and DNC member Robert Zimmerman said.   We just have to articulate our message that we re ready to lead.

Added Brent Colburn, Obama s 2012 convention communications director:  You could have the entire cast of  Hamilton  singing the entire four days, but you have to ask yourself what that gets you besides really great television.  Ratings aren t the measure of success, votes are.  Other Clinton allies are feeling confident as the former secretary of state appears to be hitting her stride while Trump blunders through one of the worst months of any campaign.  For them, the key to the convention is to take few chances and avoid screwing up.  Democrats don t have to focus on being entertaining,  Clinton fundraiser and DNC member Robert Zimmerman said.   We just have to articulate our message that we re ready to lead.                   A jury found Chaka Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering and bank fraud, among other charges.   Top House Democrats are wrestling over whether they should demand the resignation   or seek his expulsion from Congress   of Rep.  Chaka Fattah, the longtime Pennsylvania Democrat convicted Tuesday on an array of federal corruption charges. On Tuesday, a federal jury found Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and making false statements about a criminal scheme that began with Fattah's unsuccessful attempt to become mayor of Philadelphia. In the past, lawmakers found guilty of similar criminal acts resigned or were expelled by their colleagues if they didn't voluntarily leave office.  The same could happen to Fattah, although the abbreviated congressional calendar due to an election year makes it more difficult to move quickly against the veteran Democrat. In a statement released by his office, Fattah gave no sign that he was ready to step down, which would shift the burden to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and other senior Democrats to take action.  This is an extraordinarily difficult day for me and my family.  A jury has decided that based on the evidence presented to them that I am guilty of charges presented by the government, Fattah said.  Today s decision notwithstanding, it has been my privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional District for over 20 years. Fattah added: While today s outcome isn t what we had hoped, I respect our nation s judicial system.  I want to thank the people of the Second Congressional District for the honor of serving them.  Fattah, who was indicted by the Justice Department last year, had already lost the Democratic primary to state Rep.  Dwight Evans.  He is scheduled to be sentenced in October, although an appeal of his conviction is widely anticipated. Under House rules, lawmakers convicted of crimes that carry sentences of more than two years cannot vote in committee or on the floor.  That makes Fattah unable to fully participate in Congress: Bribery charges alone carry up to 20 years behind bars. But Fattah has not resigned his seat, and if he does not do so, his colleagues may be forced to expel him. Already some Republicans are publicly suggesting that if Fattah won't voluntarily leave, he should be forced out of office.  He should resign   he s been convicted,  said Rep.  Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio.   The House needs to look out for its own ethics and image.  Stivers later added:  If he won t resign, I think the House should take action  to expel him. For Democrats, it s not so easy.  Missouri Democratic Rep.  Emanuel Cleaver, a fellow Congressional Black Caucus member, said he s giving his colleague and former fraternity brother some space   at least for now. [Fattah needs time to think it over and pray about it and sit down with his family and hopefully some clergy friends and make decisions based on logic more than politics,  Cleaver said.   I m sure he is going through a lot of emotions right now.  We ought to give him time to figure out what his best next steps should be for his future and family.  Cleaver said he believed Fattah will appeal the conviction.  Asked if he should focus on that appeal rather than serving in Congress, Cleaver said,  That s what I would think  He s been convicted of seven counts.  It s devastating.  People are saying it could be 20 years. . . . Another senior black Democrat who did not wish to go on record said he thought Fattah should resign.  Democrats, after all, don t want a convicted felon in their ranks.  But they also don t want to look like they re forcing out one of their own out of office, especially if Fattah appeals. With Tuesday a travel day for lawmakers   including Pelosi   Democratic leaders were scrambling to figure out a response to Fattah's conviction.  Pelosi did not comment on the conviction, and other Democrats were reluctant to discuss it during the evening votes. Action to expel Fattah would have to be initiated by the House Ethics Committee before coming to the full House floor for a vote.  That s what happened in 2002 to the late Democratic Rep.  Jim Traficant of Ohio, who was also was convicted of federal corruption charges. If expulsion proceedings are initiated against Fattah   which would only happen if the Justice Department assured the Ethics Committee such a move would not interfere with the criminal proceedings   the trial transcript would be the key piece of evidence against him. Fattah would then be given a chance to testify on his own behalf and present evidence to defend himself, as Traficant did in 2002. House insiders suggested the Ethics Committee has not interacted with DOJ yet over the Fattah matter.  In August 2015, Ethics convened an investigative subcommittee to look into the allegations against Fattah but deferred action due to DOJ's ongoing criminal probe. House Ethics Committee Chairman Charlie Dent (R), who is also from Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the Fattah case.

Secret Service K-9 Unit patrol outside the White House on June 13.   The author of a new tell-all book about Hillary Clinton could never have seen any of what he claims   he was too low-ranking   say several high-level members of Secret Service presidential details, including the president of the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service. On Tuesday, AFAUSSS, which is strictly nonpartisan, is set to release a statement blasting Gary Byrne author of  Crisis in Character,  saying members  strongly denounce  the book, which they add has made security harder by eroding the trust between agents and the people they protect.  There is no place for any self-moralizing narratives, particularly those with an underlying motive,  reads the statement from the group s board of directors, which says Byrne has politics and profit on his mind. AFAUSSS rarely issues public statements of any kind. The book has rankled current and former members of the Secret Service, who don t like anyone airing their business in public   but who also take issue with Byrne inflating his role.  Byrne was a uniformed officer in Bill Clinton s White House.  But that s the lowest level of protection within the White House and around the president.  People familiar with West Wing security laugh at the idea that Byrne or any uniformed officer ever would have walked in on Bill Clinton anywhere, whether in a meeting or, as a New York Post article over the weekend claims, in the middle of a make-out session in the Map Room with the late daughter of former Vice President Walter Mondale.  The Secret Service presidential detail would have stopped him.  (That affair was a well-worn rumor during the Clinton years, though strongly denied by Eleanor Mondale, who died of brain cancer in 2011. ) The inner perimeter is 100 percent controlled by the presidential protective division,  said a former supervisor of the presidential protective division, who asked not to be identified by name. And if Byrne or any uniformed officer had been posted near a room the president entered, he would have been moved at least 15 yards away, to the outer edges of the security bubble   not quite what Byrne describes in his book:  I stood guard, pistol at my hip, outside the Oval Office, the last barrier before anyone saw Bill Clinton,  according to the Post, which has been teasing excerpts of the book.  Operationally, one who has the working knowledge of how things are done there would realize that certain of those statements do not coincide with the operational plan,  said Jan Gilhooly, AFAUSSS president and a 29-year Secret Service veteran. The group s statement, which POLITICO obtained in advance of its release, very carefully calls Byrne a liar.  One must question the veracity and content of any book which implies that its author played such an integral part of so many [claimed incidents.  Any critique of management by one who has never managed personnel or programs resounds hollow.  Additionally, why would an employee wait in excess of ten years after terminating his employment with the Service to make his allegations public?  it reads. The closest contact that Byrne could have had, according to Gilhooly and others, is seeing the president or the first lady pass in the hallway   far from the intimate access he would have needed to catch Bill Clinton in the act or see Hillary Clinton fly into the cursing rages he now writes have convinced him that she doesn t have the  integrity and temperament  to be president.  There could be a circumstance where a uniformed officer might be in the proximity.  It s not as if it never happens,  Gilhooly said.   It is possible, but not on a continuum.  The former supervisor of the presidential protective division said that at best Byrne is working from office rumors that he s cinematically written himself into.  People spend decades on presidential details and don t rack up the number of amazing scenes Byrne claims to have witnessed in just a few years as a uniformed officer.  Did Gary Byrne hear an anecdotal story being told by a couple of agents? Maybe.  But did Gary Byrne see it the way he s purporting to have seen it? No way.  That s a lifetime worth of events this individual saw in a very short amount of time,  the former supervisor said.   If any of the things he says happened did happen, it was told to him by a third party.  The Secret Service itself declined comment on Monday.   The Secret Service does not have any statements to offer regarding this former employee or his book,  said spokeswoman Nicole Mainor. Gilhooly, who served primarily in the details of Ronald Reagan and George H. W.  Bush, was also an inspector within the Secret Service from 1995 through 1997.  During that time, he said, he was constantly in contact with people in the White House, and often with Hillary Clinton   professionally, as well as through the former first lady writing a letter on his behalf to an insurance company with which he was having a dispute after the death of his wife in 1993.  I never once saw any kind of what I would have considered inappropriate behavior,  Gilhooly said. Gilhooly said he doesn t remember ever meeting Byrne, or knowing who he was before word of the book started circulating.  The former supervisor of the presidential protective division also said Byrne didn t ring a bell. Vanessa Oblinger, Byrne s publicist for the book, said the claim he didn t witness the events he describes in the book was  a nonsense charge.   He was posted directly outside the Oval Office for three years,  she said. She cited Byrne s performance awards and positive evaluations, as well as a letter of appreciation he received from the Secret Service in 1996 for his  commitment, dedication and professional performance.   The Clintons always trash the messenger,  Oblinger said, adding later,  This is the first of many Clinton-directed media attempts at character assassination.

Republicans are seeking to drive a wedge into an issue that s already emerging as a highly sensitive one in the Democratic platform: Israel. The latest salvo will come from the Republican Jewish Coalition this week, as the group   which is home to some of the biggest donors in GOP politics   launches an online advertising campaign attacking members of the Democratic National Committee s platform drafting committee. The RJC plan, first shared with Politico, comes as Democrats are already grappling with the possibility that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will emerge as a major flash point at their national convention next month, given the sharp disagreements some on the platform drafting committee have with one another on the issue. The RJC ads will target Arab-American activist James Zogby, public intellectual Cornel West and Minnesota Rep.  Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress.  The RJC's five-figure social media campaign characterizes the three platform committee members as  radical  Democrats who are  stridently anti-Israel,   hand-selected member[s of the Democratic platform committee.   All three were selected by Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders.  Sadly, this isn t the old Democratic Party,  each spot intones, as an image of the late President John F.  Kennedy splashes across the screen.  Switching to an image of Hillary Clinton, the voice-over continues,  It s today s Democratic Party.  Clinton herself is generally considered   especially in Democratic circles   a staunch supporter of Israel, as are a number of her allies on the platform drafting committee.  But even as Republicans face a much bigger fight over party unity than Democrats do, the RJC and others in the GOP see the potential Democratic platform fight over Israel language as an opportunity to highlight divisions on the other side.  The issue of Israel is a touchy one in Democratic circles: There was a public and embarrassing flare-up over Israel in the 2012 platform, when language declaring Jerusalem Israel s capital was removed and then reinstated into the platform, engendering some boos.  Some attendees maintain that those in the room were booing procedural methods, not the substance of the language, but the moment   and the larger back-and-forth over the language   sparked controversy nonetheless. This time around, Democrats desperately want to avoid anything that detracts from Clinton s efforts to project unity.  But there are significant differences between the party establishment, starting with Clinton herself, and the more progressive grass roots, led by Sanders, with regard to posture toward Israel, leaving open the possibility for conflict on the issue.  Sanders and some of his supporters, including those on the platform committee, are eager for what many refer to as a more  even-handed  approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even as Sanders has also said he believes in Israel s security.  The RJC is hoping to force those Democratic disagreements into the open.   As we ve seen over the last couple months, the Democratic Party is getting nervous about the amount of real estate these voices are taking up,  said Mark McNulty, a spokesman for the RJC, of the Sanders picks.  He went on to add,  From 2012 on, and sometimes before that, we have seen divisions within the Democratic Party when it comes to Israel and pertinent Jewish issues.  This is just another time for us to make the case to Jewish voters that their interests are better served by Republicans.  Those disagreements within the Democratic Party were highlighted last week, when, during a DNC platform hearing in Washington, West and Zogby clashed with former Rep.  Robert Wexler, a Clinton supporter (though not on the committee this year), over whether the word  occupation  should be used to describe Israel s control of Palestinian territories, a word that makes staunch Israel supporters cringe, but that more progressive voices -- as well as the State Department -- consider an accurate description.                              Rep.  Keith Ellison introduces Sen.  Bernie Sanders at a forum on race and economic opportunity on February 12, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.    At the meeting, Wexler said that it isn't the party s place to call Israel an occupier, while West and Zogby maintained it is essential for Democrats to use the term.  That debate underscored the sharp disagreements in the party on the issue, tensions Democrats acknowledge. Asked whether the issue of Middle East peace could be a key flash point, Dwight Bullard, the Democratic chairman of heavily Jewish Miami-Dade County replied,  Politically speaking this could be it.  I think there's enough red meat out there of issues that [it could be contentious.  Added Dennis Ross, a veteran of Middle Eastern policy who served as a special adviser to Clinton at the State Department,  I think there are some divisions within the Democratic Party on the issue.  Clearly I think the more mainstream, centrist part of the party tends to believe support for Israel is the kind of standard of principle by which it wants to be identified.  Looking at what might be described as the more Sanders wing, [they are ready to raise questions about that.  The committee is set to continue hammering out language at a draft committee meeting this weekend in St.  Louis.  Clinton has six allies on the committee, to Sanders  five, along with four other members selected by the DNC.  We re still in the process of creating the platform,  said Dana Vickers Shelley, a spokeswoman for the DNC platform committee.   I m comfortable that the party s words and actions will be consistent in support of Israel s security and safety.  Ross and other Clinton allies downplayed the notion that that debate will unfold via the platform committee at the convention, noting that Sanders has spent much more time prioritizing economic issues than he has the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Sen.  Sanders and the vast majority of his delegates, his strongest supporters, are rightfully most concerned about economic justice, about income inequality, and the many economic issues, domestic issues that Sen.  Sanders based his presidential campaign on,  Wexler said.   Foreign policy was not Sen.  Sanders  focus.  And while he did make a statement or two regarding Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it s not the focus of his campaign, nor do I think it will be the focus of the convention.  Matt Duss, a Middle East expert who testified last week at the behest of the Sanders campaign, said the Clinton camp s more centrist approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would likely prevail at the convention   but that won t paper over the significant areas of disagreement that remain on the issue.   I m happy to have been asked by the Sanders campaign to share my views, but at the end of the day, Clinton is the nominee, so her choices are probably going to carry the day,  Duss said.   But I just hope there s an understanding that this is a debate that s not going to go away.  Daniel Strauss contributed to this report.

Matt Duss, a Middle East expert who testified last week at the behest of the Sanders campaign, said the Clinton camp s more centrist approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would likely prevail at the convention   but that won t paper over the significant areas of disagreement that remain on the issue.   I m happy to have been asked by the Sanders campaign to share my views, but at the end of the day, Clinton is the nominee, so her choices are probably going to carry the day,  Duss said.   But I just hope there s an understanding that this is a debate that s not going to go away.  Daniel Strauss contributed to this report.                  Mark Cuban said Donald Trump has been getting stupider as the campaign progresses.   Mark Cuban stepped up his criticism of Donald Trump s campaign on Tuesday, this time attacking him personally.

It s a difficult thing to do but he s accomplished it,  the billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner said in an interview with Extra.  Earlier on Tuesday, Cuban tweeted saying Trump  doesn t have the cash  to fund his own campaign, following a Federal Election Commission report showing his campaign had $1. 3 million compared to Hillary Clinton s $42 million at the beginning of June. Cuban also told Extra on the set of ABC's Shark Tank that the presumptive nominee had to  start learning and understanding the issues.    Donald has been at this a year but you don t look at him and say,  Wow, he s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic.

The author of a new tell-all book about Hillary Clinton could never have seen any of what he claims   he was too low-ranking   say several high-level members of Secret Service presidential details, including the president of the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service. On Tuesday, AFAUSSS, which is strictly nonpartisan, is set to release a statement blasting Gary Byrne author of  Crisis in Character,  saying members  strongly denounce  the book, which they add has made security harder by eroding the trust between agents and the people they protect.  There is no place for any self-moralizing narratives, particularly those with an underlying motive,  reads the statement from the group s board of directors, which says Byrne has politics and profit on his mind. AFAUSSS rarely issues public statements of any kind. The book has rankled current and former members of the Secret Service, who don t like anyone airing their business in public   but who also take issue with Byrne inflating his role.  Byrne was a uniformed officer in Bill Clinton s White House.  But that s the lowest level of protection within the White House and around the president.  People familiar with West Wing security laugh at the idea that Byrne or any uniformed officer ever would have walked in on Bill Clinton anywhere, whether in a meeting or, as a New York Post article over the weekend claims, in the middle of a make-out session in the Map Room with the late daughter of former Vice President Walter Mondale.  The Secret Service presidential detail would have stopped him.  (That affair was a well-worn rumor during the Clinton years, though strongly denied by Eleanor Mondale, who died of brain cancer in 2011. ) The inner perimeter is 100 percent controlled by the presidential protective division,  said a former supervisor of the presidential protective division, who asked not to be identified by name. And if Byrne or any uniformed officer had been posted near a room the president entered, he would have been moved at least 15 yards away, to the outer edges of the security bubble   not quite what Byrne describes in his book:  I stood guard, pistol at my hip, outside the Oval Office, the last barrier before anyone saw Bill Clinton,  according to the Post, which has been teasing excerpts of the book.  Operationally, one who has the working knowledge of how things are done there would realize that certain of those statements do not coincide with the operational plan,  said Jan Gilhooly, AFAUSSS president and a 29-year Secret Service veteran. The group s statement, which POLITICO obtained in advance of its release, very carefully calls Byrne a liar.  One must question the veracity and content of any book which implies that its author played such an integral part of so many [claimed incidents.  Any critique of management by one who has never managed personnel or programs resounds hollow.  Additionally, why would an employee wait in excess of ten years after terminating his employment with the Service to make his allegations public?  it reads. The closest contact that Byrne could have had, according to Gilhooly and others, is seeing the president or the first lady pass in the hallway   far from the intimate access he would have needed to catch Bill Clinton in the act or see Hillary Clinton fly into the cursing rages he now writes have convinced him that she doesn t have the  integrity and temperament  to be president.  There could be a circumstance where a uniformed officer might be in the proximity.  It s not as if it never happens,  Gilhooly said.   It is possible, but not on a continuum.  The former supervisor of the presidential protective division said that at best Byrne is working from office rumors that he s cinematically written himself into.  People spend decades on presidential details and don t rack up the number of amazing scenes Byrne claims to have witnessed in just a few years as a uniformed officer.  Did Gary Byrne hear an anecdotal story being told by a couple of agents? Maybe.  But did Gary Byrne see it the way he s purporting to have seen it? No way.  That s a lifetime worth of events this individual saw in a very short amount of time,  the former supervisor said.   If any of the things he says happened did happen, it was told to him by a third party.  The Secret Service itself declined comment on Monday.   The Secret Service does not have any statements to offer regarding this former employee or his book,  said spokeswoman Nicole Mainor. Gilhooly, who served primarily in the details of Ronald Reagan and George H. W.  Bush, was also an inspector within the Secret Service from 1995 through 1997.  During that time, he said, he was constantly in contact with people in the White House, and often with Hillary Clinton   professionally, as well as through the former first lady writing a letter on his behalf to an insurance company with which he was having a dispute after the death of his wife in 1993.  I never once saw any kind of what I would have considered inappropriate behavior,  Gilhooly said. Gilhooly said he doesn t remember ever meeting Byrne, or knowing who he was before word of the book started circulating.  The former supervisor of the presidential protective division also said Byrne didn t ring a bell. Vanessa Oblinger, Byrne s publicist for the book, said the claim he didn t witness the events he describes in the book was  a nonsense charge.   He was posted directly outside the Oval Office for three years,  she said. She cited Byrne s performance awards and positive evaluations, as well as a letter of appreciation he received from the Secret Service in 1996 for his  commitment, dedication and professional performance.   The Clintons always trash the messenger,  Oblinger said, adding later,  This is the first of many Clinton-directed media attempts at character assassination.

Democratic operatives planning next month s national convention in Philadelphia have reached out to Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award-winning writer and star of the hit Broadway musical  Hamilton,  about performing at the Wells Fargo Center, sources told POLITICO. It s part of an ambitious plan to generate excitement and boost television viewership for the party convention after what Democrats expect to be a four-day reality show at the Republican convention in Cleveland. Miranda s name currently tops a lineup of A-list stars, including well-known young pop artists whomClinton campaign and Democratic National Committee officials are reaching out to as convention program planning gets underway, according to Democrats familiar with the process. Miranda   who free-styled in the Rose Garden earlier this year with President Barack Obama and whose show is now selling tickets for as much as $10,000 a pop   is proving a tough get even for Clinton.  The star performer and composer, who last week announced he will leave his Broadway production July 9, is scheduled to be in London filming a Disney remake of  Mary Poppins  the week of the Democratic convention. His father, Luis Miranda Jr. , a major player in New York Democratic politics, said,  There is no truth to these rumors  about his son s potential star turn at the convention.  A spokesman for the Clinton campaign and a spokesman for the DNC declined to comment. But the push for Miranda, as well as other A-listers with a point of view, is a sign that Clinton operatives are seeking to engage core Democratic groups like young voters, African-Americans and Latinos, with headliners other than the expected roster of gray-haired politicians.  The nights are three-hour prime-time TV shows,  said PR executive Ken Sunshine, a Clinton fundraiser with deep ties to the entertainment world.   Entertainment and adding excitement become a key part of it, as opposed to hard-core politics.  The one that understands that is Trump, except that s all he seems to understand.  Unlike the GOP   where party leaders like Mitt Romney, Sen.  John McCain and the entire Bush family have all said they plan to sit out the convention   Democrats have a deep bench of political heavyweights to choose from as headliners.  Obama is expected to speak, playing the role of the highest-profile  convert  to Clinton, giving skeptical progressives and independents license to support his former rival. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton s still-to-be-selected running mate are also expected to have prime-time slots.  First lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden could also make the case for Clinton, and Bernie Sanders is expected to deliver a prime-time speech if he concedes before July 25. The ultimate goal of the convention, according to operatives involved in the planning, is to produce a  coming together  moment that unites the party against Trump. But second to party unity is the goal of producing some memorable, watchable moments that will encourage core Democratic demos to tune in to the live cable coverage of the four-day convention   and share it broadly across social media. Unlike the 2008 convention in Denver, at which Democrats nominated Obama on a mandate of hope and change and needed to introduce him on the biggest stage of his political life, Clinton, for many Democratic voters, feels like a known commodity.  She s an establishment politician with high unfavorable ratings, who has spoken at every Democratic convention for the past two decades and struggled over the past year to generate enthusiasm for her campaign. With back-to-back conventions   Trump s nominating convention in Cleveland is July 18-21, followed by Clinton s convention in Philadelphia July 25-28   some Democrats feel a need to create additional experiences around the nominee that can energize voters. Going second is considered an advantage   it gives Democrats the last word.  And Clinton campaign insiders said much of what takes place in Philadelphia will be in reaction to the Republican convention, making contrasts with Trump a key consideration throughout the four days.  The campaign will also have a  counter convention  presence in Cleveland, headed up by deputy communications director Christina Reynolds, sources said.  Clinton s campaign would not say how many rapid response operatives it plans to send to Cleveland. But following   and countering   an unconventional candidate like Trump also raises the entertainment stakes in Philadelphia.  In Cleveland, Trump plans to flout tradition by possibly taking the stage every night himself, and announcing his running mate live on prime-time television.  He's a political Kardashian,  said Democratic strategist Tommy Vietor, a former aide to Obama.   His campaign has been the longest, grossest sex tape ever released.  Some Democrats involved with the campaign worry that without big, out-of-the-box  moments,  Trump coverage   even if it s negative   will spill over into Clinton s big week.  And while Clinton seems to have found her footing attacking an opponent whose bare-bones campaign appears to be in free fall, her campaign still needs to put out a clear and positive message about the Democratic nominee.  Entertaining acts can accentuate that, said Clinton allies.  Good entertainment doesn t have to appeal to the lowest level of expression,  said Sunshine.   Great art and humor can be inspirational, uplifting, can celebrate our diversity instead of cheap laughs at the expense of other Americans.  Clinton has no shortage of celebrities to choose from.  Pop stars like Katy Perry, Demi Lovato and Christina Aguilera have performed at fundraisers and campaign rallies.  Perry, who performed at a Clinton rally in Des Moines ahead of last year s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa, was so enthralled with the campaign, operatives said, that she requested a meeting with Clinton s policy advisers and then sat through the hours-long rubber chicken dinner listening to speeches by local elected officials. Beyonc  has also attended a Clinton fundraiser.  Hollywood power brokers like Steven Spielberg, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Rob Reiner are all backing Clinton.  Oprah Winfrey announced her endorsement last week.  And comedians like Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham have acted as stalwart campaign surrogates.  They won t have a lack of entertainment,  said a close Clinton ally. But some veterans of conventions past warn about relying too heavily on getting a lift from bold-faced names, pointing to the Republicans  failed Clint Eastwood strategy from 2012, when the actor delivered a widely mocked surprise speech at the Tampa convention, addressing an empty chair.  You certainly want to do things that would draw eyes,  said Democratic strategist and former Obama aide Ben LaBolt.   The risk of doing something outrageous is Clint Eastwood under a different name.  That was the Republican thinking heading into the last one, and they way overshot the runway and landed on the moon.  Of any entertainment ideas, he said,  It s got to serve the core message.  Outsourcing the convention to Clint Eastwood is not a good idea.  Added Brent Colburn, Obama s 2012 convention communications director:  You could have the entire cast of  Hamilton  singing the entire four days, but you have to ask yourself what that gets you besides really great television.  Ratings aren t the measure of success, votes are.  Other Clinton allies are feeling confident as the former secretary of state appears to be hitting her stride while Trump blunders through one of the worst months of any campaign.  For them, the key to the convention is to take few chances and avoid screwing up.  Democrats don t have to focus on being entertaining,  Clinton fundraiser and DNC member Robert Zimmerman said.   We just have to articulate our message that we re ready to lead.   Donald Trump s campaign started the month with a paltry $1. 3 million in cash   a mere fraction of Hillary Clinton's $42. 5 million war chest   putting the GOP front-runner at a sharp disadvantage heading into the general election against Clinton s money machine.  On the same day that Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, amid a steady stream of reports of campaign infighting and disorganization, the latest batch of Federal Election Commission filings show that the real estate mogul has a long way to go to establish a financial operation that can compete at the national level.  And it s not just money   the filings revealed a campaign staff of less than 70, a number dwarfed by Clinton s nearly 700 paid employees, and few of the campaign s expenses suggested work had begun to build out a more robust operation.  All together, it s the most lopsided fundraising start to a presidential election in the modern campaign finance era. The filings detail campaign finances covering the month of May, during which Trump locked up the GOP nomination after the May 3 Indiana primary.  Republicans had hoped that Trump s clearing of the field would prompt their donors to rally behind their presumptive nominee and allow him to close the gap with Clinton s campaign, which was still struggling to finish off primary rival Bernie Sanders. Instead, the campaign showed no clear path for improving its financial picture.  Trump raised just $3. 1 million from donors (including almost $2 million in amounts less than $200) and lent his campaign $2. 2 million, though he said he won t continue self-funding through the general election.  Trump has now loaned his campaign a total of $45. 7 million, almost exactly the same amount that Mitt Romney loaned his 2008 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.  Unlike Romney, who mostly downplayed his wealth, Trump s boasts about his wealth and his willingness to self-finance his campaign were a central part of his message during the primary.  Trump castigated his primary opponents for being beholden to big donors and called out the donors as puppet masters.  So when Trump decided that he would seek to raise outside money for his own election, the reversal was awkward, not least because he had failed to assemble a finance operation for his skeletal campaign. On the bright side, Trump's campaign trimmed spending from $9. 4 million in April to $6. 7 million in May.  But with so little money in the bank, frugality alone won't make the operation more competitive.  Even the defunct campaigns of Ted Cruz and Ben Carson had more cash on hand than Trump s.  In fact, several House members running for reelection have more cash on hand than Trump s campaign.  Peter King (R-N. Y. ) had $3 million, Joe Kennedy (D-Mass. ) reported $2. 2 million, Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N. Y. ) and Lee Zeldin (R-N. Y. ) each reported about $1. 8 million, and Mike Coffman (R-Colo. ) had $1. 4 million.  Comparing cash figures was always a little spurious in the primaries, with Trump poised to pump more money into his own campaign (despite conflicting accounts of his actual wealth and liquidity).  But he has made clear he won t bankroll his bid through November, and he s still a long way from the $300 million his backers say they hope to raise   already a retreat from Trump's original $1 billion goal.  Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign and its allied super PAC have already amassed more than $300 million. The May FEC report showed just 69 people on payroll, to Clinton s 685.  And the Trump campaign s spending offered no signs that it is building a national campaign infrastructure.  The biggest expenditures included $350,000 for the use of Trump s private jet; $493,000 to rent Trump facilities such as Mar-A-Lago, the Trump winery and two of his golf clubs; and $208,000 on hats. By comparison, the campaign spent only $48,000 on data management and $115,000 on online advertising. The campaign, which has been hounded by sometimes violent protests and disruptions, paid the Secret Service $179,000 and $59,000 to private security company XMark. One sign of a fledgling fundraising operation was $3 million raised for the Republican National Committee through Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee formed late in the month. The campaign spent just $227,500 on direct mail, $150,000 on placed media and $80,000 on online advertising, according to the FEC filing. The Trump campaign has yet to reserve any air time for advertising in the fall, and he might not be able to rely on super PACs.  The real estate mogul s inflammatory attacks on a federal judge and renewed calls for a ban on Muslim immigration have failed to endear him to the party s leading donors, and one of the main outside groups supporting him, Great America PAC, raised just $1. 4 million in May.  A growing number of Democratic senators support reforming the party s superdelegate system   a move that would dilute their own power in the presidential nominating process but satisfy Bernie Sanders and his millions of supporters as Democrats move to unify for the general election.  Politico interviewed nearly 20 of Sanders  colleagues over the past week and found a surprisingly strong appetite for change, including among influential members of the party establishment such as Sen.  Tim Kaine (D-Va. ), a top prospect for vice president.  More than half the senators surveyed support at least lowering the number of superdelegates, and all but two said the party should take up the matter at next month s convention in Philadelphia, despite the potential for a high-profile intraparty feud at a critical moment in the campaign.  The findings point to growing momentum among Democrats for changing a system that s been criticized for giving party bigwigs undue sway over the nominee at the expense of the grass roots.  But powerful Democratic Party constituencies, including the Congressional Black Caucus, are firmly opposed.  And lawmakers who are open to reform disagree over how far-reaching it should be.   It s not useful to anyone to be in a position where you could potentially overturn the will of the electorate.  I mean nobody likes this, and it undermines public confidence,  said Sen.  Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who has spoken privately to a dozen other Democratic senators about the matter.  His support for scrapping superdelegates isn t shared by a majority of the Senate Democratic Caucus, but it could be a starting point for negotiations.  Some senators declined to comment, not wanting to alienate activists or party bosses.  And a significant number of Democrats said they re fine with however it plays out but just want to put the drama over nominating rules to rest.   I want Bernie in the fold, I want him enthusiastic,  said Sen.  Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another potential VP choice.   I m fine with whatever they negotiate, I just don t care about superdelegates.  I don t care about the whole thing.   The 714 superdelegates   members of Congress, governors, state party chairs and other Democratic elites   are meant to give battle-hardened Democrats a steadying hand on the selection process, as a bulwark against a candidate who might rouse the grass roots and romp to the nomination but end up being a poor general election standard-bearer.  But Sanders and his supporters argue the system gives too much power to party elites and could lead to a scenario in which members of Congress defy the will of voters.  At points during the campaign, Sanders argued that Hillary Clinton might not have been able to win without superdelegates, though ultimately they were not the difference-maker.  Even Donald Trump has knocked the Democrats  rules as undemocratic.  The sustained push by Sanders supporters, combined with Clinton s interest in winning over his backers, is likely to push the issue onto the agenda in Philadelphia.   It s something we should debate,  said Sen.  Tom Carper of Delaware.   There s probably a middle ground somewhere between get rid of every single superdelegate and maintaining the status quo.   The conflict over party rules started brewing many months before any primary or caucus votes were cast.  A number of Democrats in Congress who serve as superdelegates lined up behind Clinton, giving her a significant delegate lead even before the Iowa caucuses.  After the New Hampshire primary, the inherent conflict was evident: Sanders crushed Clinton in the Granite State, but the state s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, had already endorsed Clinton.  That rankled many in the party, particularly liberals.   I d like to see the Democratic Party be as democratic as possible,  said Sen.  Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.  Her view is shared by Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) and a clutch of other liberal lawmakers.  But they have powerful opposition.  The Congressional Black Caucus and Sen.  Chuck Schumer of New York, the future Democratic leader, oppose tinkering with the system.  CBC Chairman G. K.  Butterfield of North Carolina said he was  outraged  to even hear about it, arguing that  eliminating superdelegates would be discriminatory and prevent African-American officeholders from participating in the convention.    I m fine with the superdelegates,  Schumer said in an interview.   Caucuses harness the energy of individual people, they re legitimate.  Superdelegates harness those who worked in the party a long time.  I m for having a nice mixture.   Given the resistance of Schumer and other longtime senators like Bill Nelson of Florida, proponents of eliminating the superdelegate system altogether may just be making an initial bid ahead of the talks in Philadelphia.  Several supporters of reform said it s more realistic to get rid of some superdelegates but not scuttle the system altogether.  Some Democrats argued that Republicans might have been well served by having superdelegates this year.   They might have been able to prevent Trump.  So I think that superdelegates play a big role,  said Sen.  Tom Udall of New Mexico, who supports eliminating half the party s superdelegates.   If Trump ends up being a disaster, [Republicans are going to try to figure out    How do we prevent this from happening [again?  And my guess is the way they will do it is come up with something like a superdelegate model.   Another problem for those looking to kill the two-tiered system? Politicians usually stubbornly resist efforts to water down their own power.   Asking a superdelegate to get rid of themselves?  asked Sen.  Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who wants a commission to examine party rules.   I would like to hear more from the grass roots than my colleagues on this.   Plus, if superdelegates were eliminated, senators who wanted to attend the convention could be faced with the awkward situation of running for delegate slots against their own constituents.  The CBC made that argument in letters to party leaders over the weekend, and several senators raised the specter of ugly jockeying for delegate slots.   It s complicated.  Congress-people, do you want them at a convention? How do they get to a convention? Do you want them to run against somebody in the district?  asked Sen.  Maria Cantwell of Washington, who is willing to entertain some reforms.  Some party officials are looking for a workaround.  One option under discussion is binding superdelegates  votes to the results in their state.   Having party leaders participate is fine but I think having some connection to the outcome of your state s process is smart,  said Kaine, a former Democratic National Committee chairman.   It s important that the elected officials [and party leaders have an official role in the party conventions.  I m not as concerned about their votes affecting who the nominee is at our convention,  said Sen.  Ben Cardin of Maryland. The Sanders and Clinton campaigns declined to comment. It s unclear, though, whether Sanders and his supporters would accept a middle ground.  Democratic Party officials in a number of states, including Wisconsin and Maine, have already taken votes in favor of scrapping superdelegates. That could make it hard for progressives to accept a half-measure.   We should get rid of superdelegates entirely,  said Sen.  Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the only senator to endorse Sanders.   There are a tremendous number of delegates who feel like these superdelegate votes are fundamentally inconsistent with the soul of the Democratic Party.  Tony Romm contributed to this report.                  GOP leaders are holding out hope that the Corey Lewandowski firing will led Donald Trump to run a more professional campaign.    The ouster of Donald Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday brought back a familiar refrain on Capitol Hill: Maybe now the presumptive GOP nominee s campaign will finally change. To the endless frustration of GOP senators, Trump's campaign that has repeatedly shrugged off their advice to tone down the rhetoric, focus on policy and lay off tough talk aimed at federal judges and minority groups.

GOP leaders are holding out hope that the Corey Lewandowski firing will led Donald Trump to run a more professional campaign.    The ouster of Donald Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday brought back a familiar refrain on Capitol Hill: Maybe now the presumptive GOP nominee s campaign will finally change.

Last week he dodged when asked about Trump's insinuations that President Barack Obama might be sympathetic to ISIL.   AP PhotoMitch McConnell is so enthusiastic about Donald Trump's nomination that he can barely speak. For the second straight week, the Senate Majority Leader refused to talk about the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, declining to touch a question about Trump's lackluster fundraising.  FEC filings show Trump has about $1. 3 million on hand, a sum that's dwarfed by Hillary Clinton's $42 million. I don't particularly want to sit here today and critique the presidential campaigns, McConnell said flatly when asked about the glaring disparity.  It's the second straight week McConnell has refused to respond to questions about Trump.  Last week he dodged when asked about Trump's insinuations that President Barack Obama might be sympathetic to ISIL.  I m not going to be commenting on the presidential candidates today,  he said a week.  Previously, McConnell has urged Trump to be a more scripted and more predictable candidate rather than attacking federal judges and talking about banning Muslims from the United States. At least McConnell isn't alone in his ban on Trump talk: His chief deputy, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas has begged off Trump talk for a couple weeks now.                   Hillary Clinton had overwhelming support from House and Senate Democrats during her long primary fight with Sen.  Bernie Sanders (I-Vt. ).   AP PhotoPresumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will meet with House Democrats on Wednesday, according to party sources. It will be her first appearance before House Democrats since securing the party's nomination, and it will give rank-and-file Democrats a chance to publicly display their support for Clinton. Clinton is coming to the Hill at the invitation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (Calif. ). Clinton had overwhelming support from House and Senate Democrats during her long primary fight with Sen.  Bernie Sanders (I-Vt. ), and party leaders are pleased so far with her efforts to unite Democrats since clinching the nomination.  Clinton has been formally endorsed by President Barack Obama and the rest of the party leadership, and she has meet privately with Sanders to try to smooth over their relationship.  Clinton is now vetting potential vice presidential picks, raising money and assembling a nationwide campaign organization as she prepares for the Democratic convention in Philadelphia next month. And compared to Republicans and the drama surrounding Donald Trump, the presumptive Democrats seem to be the picture of consensus and conciliation. Trump is scheduled to meet with House Republicans on July 7, according to GOP leaders.                  Irish prime minister Enda Kenny recently called Trump s views 'racist and dangerous. ' But then he quickly clarified that he would be willing to meet with the American businessman.   DUBLIN, Ireland   Want to make an Irish government official smile? Ask about Vice President Joe Biden s arrival in the Emerald Isle tomorrow.  Want to make them squirm? Ask them about the possibility that Donald Trump may crash the party.  The presumptive GOP presidential nominee tweeted last month that he would visit a Trump golf course in Ireland June 24 on top of a visit to his country club in Scotland   all, incidentally, as citizens of the United Kingdom vote in the landmark Brexit referendum on whether the U. K.  should remain in the European Union.  The trip isn t on the schedule that Trump s team gave to reporters last week.  But if he does show up, some Trump critics in the Emerald Isle are planning protests against over his views on Muslims, immigrants and more, however.   If he comes, we ll be out there protesting,  Eamon Ryan, a former energy minister who s now the head of the Irish Green Party, told POLITICO  In a globalized world, if he gets in, that does damage to us.  The Brexit referendum adds an odd backdrop: the campaign has been dominated by its own debates over immigration, diversity and tolerance and has regularly drawn comparisons to the U. S.  presidential race. And by a quirk of timing, Democrats will have an on-the-ground rapid-response team ready: Biden, who will be making his first extended visit to the old sod from June 21-25.  Irish politicians are clamoring for an audience with Biden.  The vice president, for whom Irish jokes are a go-to applause line, arrived in Ireland Tuesday and will look into his family roots before capping the week with a speech about the  values of tolerance, diversity and inclusiveness  in Dublin, according to his office. In contrast, Irish government officials have been awkwardly discussing how to deal with a potential visit by a Trump, a divisive figure who's nevertheless a potential head of state   and an investor in Ireland   officials told POLITICO. Trump was feted by the Irish government two years ago when he bought the course.  But things have obviously changed a bit in the last two years.  Irish prime minister Enda Kenny recently called Trump s views  racist and dangerous.   But then he quickly clarified that he would be willing to meet with the American businessman   a reflection of Ireland s reputation as a business-friendly country. Irish officials reacted awkwardly when the topic of Trump same up.   I ve always been an Obama man, and Trump is no Obama,  offered Eoghan Murphy, the Irish minister of state in charge of financial services, in an interview with POLITICO. Ryan, the Green Party leader, says he intends to organize protests in the town of Ennis, near the gold course, and on O Connell Street in Dublin.  The road is named after Daniel O Connell   an Irish nationalist leader who was friends with American abolitionist and civil rights leader Frederick Douglas and was devoted to  American constitutional values,  Ryan says.   That s not Trump.    President Barack Obama endorsed LinkedIn as a job search tool Monday, joking that he would use the professional social media network to seek employment after he leaves the White House. America is  an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama said, after ticking through a list of facts that support that statement. As he frequently does when speaking to younger people, Obama made the case that if given the choice to live in any era   not knowing what your gender, ethnicity or class would be    you would choose right now.   You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history,  he said in his keynote address at the Washington Hilton for the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit.   Less violent.  Less driven by division.  You d choose today.  Obama touted the country s steady rate of private sector job growth, high school graduation rate, percentage of Americans insured under Obamacare, slow growth of health care costs and  high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field.   Our rule of law, our mature capital markets   all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama added.   Now that s a pretty good sales pitch.  I don t mind being America s pitchman, and in seven months or so   in seven months or so, I ll be on the job market, and I m glad I m gonna be here.  I m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.  In February, the president posted on LinkedIn about his first summer job scooping ice cream to announce a summer job initiative for young people.  My first summer job wasn t exactly glamorous, but it taught me some valuable lessons.  Responsibility.  Hard work.  Balancing a job with friends, family, and school,  Obama wrote.   We re kicking off a Summer Opportunity Project that brings together state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses   including LinkedIn   to get young people into their first jobs and create strong transitions between school years and from high school to college and careers.   A growing number of Democratic senators support reforming the party s superdelegate system   a move that would dilute their own power in the presidential nominating process but satisfy Bernie Sanders and his millions of supporters as Democrats move to unify for the general election.  Politico interviewed nearly 20 of Sanders  colleagues over the past week and found a surprisingly strong appetite for change, including among influential members of the party establishment such as Sen.  Tim Kaine (D-Va. ), a top prospect for vice president.  More than half the senators surveyed support at least lowering the number of superdelegates, and all but two said the party should take up the matter at next month s convention in Philadelphia, despite the potential for a high-profile intraparty feud at a critical moment in the campaign.  The findings point to growing momentum among Democrats for changing a system that s been criticized for giving party bigwigs undue sway over the nominee at the expense of the grass roots.  But powerful Democratic Party constituencies, including the Congressional Black Caucus, are firmly opposed.  And lawmakers who are open to reform disagree over how far-reaching it should be.   It s not useful to anyone to be in a position where you could potentially overturn the will of the electorate.  I mean nobody likes this, and it undermines public confidence,  said Sen.  Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who has spoken privately to a dozen other Democratic senators about the matter.  His support for scrapping superdelegates isn t shared by a majority of the Senate Democratic Caucus, but it could be a starting point for negotiations.  Some senators declined to comment, not wanting to alienate activists or party bosses.  And a significant number of Democrats said they re fine with however it plays out but just want to put the drama over nominating rules to rest.   I want Bernie in the fold, I want him enthusiastic,  said Sen.  Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another potential VP choice.   I m fine with whatever they negotiate, I just don t care about superdelegates.  I don t care about the whole thing.   The 714 superdelegates   members of Congress, governors, state party chairs and other Democratic elites   are meant to give battle-hardened Democrats a steadying hand on the selection process, as a bulwark against a candidate who might rouse the grass roots and romp to the nomination but end up being a poor general election standard-bearer.  But Sanders and his supporters argue the system gives too much power to party elites and could lead to a scenario in which members of Congress defy the will of voters.  At points during the campaign, Sanders argued that Hillary Clinton might not have been able to win without superdelegates, though ultimately they were not the difference-maker.  Even Donald Trump has knocked the Democrats  rules as undemocratic.  The sustained push by Sanders supporters, combined with Clinton s interest in winning over his backers, is likely to push the issue onto the agenda in Philadelphia.   It s something we should debate,  said Sen.  Tom Carper of Delaware.   There s probably a middle ground somewhere between get rid of every single superdelegate and maintaining the status quo.   The conflict over party rules started brewing many months before any primary or caucus votes were cast.  A number of Democrats in Congress who serve as superdelegates lined up behind Clinton, giving her a significant delegate lead even before the Iowa caucuses.  After the New Hampshire primary, the inherent conflict was evident: Sanders crushed Clinton in the Granite State, but the state s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, had already endorsed Clinton.  That rankled many in the party, particularly liberals.   I d like to see the Democratic Party be as democratic as possible,  said Sen.  Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.  Her view is shared by Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) and a clutch of other liberal lawmakers.  But they have powerful opposition.  The Congressional Black Caucus and Sen.  Chuck Schumer of New York, the future Democratic leader, oppose tinkering with the system.  CBC Chairman G. K.  Butterfield of North Carolina said he was  outraged  to even hear about it, arguing that  eliminating superdelegates would be discriminatory and prevent African-American officeholders from participating in the convention.    I m fine with the superdelegates,  Schumer said in an interview.   Caucuses harness the energy of individual people, they re legitimate.  Superdelegates harness those who worked in the party a long time.  I m for having a nice mixture.   Given the resistance of Schumer and other longtime senators like Bill Nelson of Florida, proponents of eliminating the superdelegate system altogether may just be making an initial bid ahead of the talks in Philadelphia.  Several supporters of reform said it s more realistic to get rid of some superdelegates but not scuttle the system altogether.  Some Democrats argued that Republicans might have been well served by having superdelegates this year.   They might have been able to prevent Trump.  So I think that superdelegates play a big role,  said Sen.  Tom Udall of New Mexico, who supports eliminating half the party s superdelegates.   If Trump ends up being a disaster, [Republicans are going to try to figure out    How do we prevent this from happening [again?  And my guess is the way they will do it is come up with something like a superdelegate model.   Another problem for those looking to kill the two-tiered system? Politicians usually stubbornly resist efforts to water down their own power.   Asking a superdelegate to get rid of themselves?  asked Sen.  Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who wants a commission to examine party rules.   I would like to hear more from the grass roots than my colleagues on this.   Plus, if superdelegates were eliminated, senators who wanted to attend the convention could be faced with the awkward situation of running for delegate slots against their own constituents.  The CBC made that argument in letters to party leaders over the weekend, and several senators raised the specter of ugly jockeying for delegate slots.   It s complicated.  Congress-people, do you want them at a convention? How do they get to a convention? Do you want them to run against somebody in the district?  asked Sen.  Maria Cantwell of Washington, who is willing to entertain some reforms.  Some party officials are looking for a workaround.  One option under discussion is binding superdelegates  votes to the results in their state.   Having party leaders participate is fine but I think having some connection to the outcome of your state s process is smart,  said Kaine, a former Democratic National Committee chairman.   It s important that the elected officials [and party leaders have an official role in the party conventions.  I m not as concerned about their votes affecting who the nominee is at our convention,  said Sen.  Ben Cardin of Maryland. The Sanders and Clinton campaigns declined to comment. It s unclear, though, whether Sanders and his supporters would accept a middle ground.  Democratic Party officials in a number of states, including Wisconsin and Maine, have already taken votes in favor of scrapping superdelegates. That could make it hard for progressives to accept a half-measure.   We should get rid of superdelegates entirely,  said Sen.  Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the only senator to endorse Sanders.   There are a tremendous number of delegates who feel like these superdelegate votes are fundamentally inconsistent with the soul of the Democratic Party.  Tony Romm contributed to this report.

There are a tremendous number of delegates who feel like these superdelegate votes are fundamentally inconsistent with the soul of the Democratic Party.  Tony Romm contributed to this report.  For months, senior adviser Paul Manafort spearheaded the effort urging Donald Trump to dial it back a little and pursue a more conventional tack that would keep campaign drama and controversy at a minimum. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, on the other hand, insisted the presumptive GOP nominee should continue at full throttle.   Let Trump be Trump  was his mantra. On Monday, Manafort s argument won. The abrupt ouster of Lewandowski, less than one month prior to the Republican National Convention, suggested that Trump s recent slide in the polls   and the growing evidence that his campaign has fallen far behind in executing general-election fundamentals   has finally sparked a rethinking of the campaign s approach, beginning at the top.  If it signals that Donald Trump is taking his responsibility to pivot to a general election posture seriously, then it is good news,  said Michael Steel, a former adviser to Jeb Bush and John Boehner.   If not, it s continuing the narrative of chaos and division that has marked his candidacy so far.  In recent elections, similar high-level shake-ups have been a hallmark of ultimately doomed campaigns.  After she fell into an early hole in her first presidential bid in 2008, Hillary Clinton in February of that year replaced campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle with Maggie Williams, another longtime adviser.  The previous July, with his campaign floundering, John McCain had replaced campaign manager Terry Nelson and top aide John Weaver   a move that set him on the path to winning the nomination, though the Arizona senator fell short against President Barack Obama in the general election. The Trump campaign change in leadership has an added element of risk   it s taking place far later in the election cycle, just 140 days from the November election.  And it s taking place at a time when a national campaign is already expected to have in place a serious ground infrastructure and television plan. Instead, Democratic field teams in some swing states alone have more employees than Trump s entire national staff.  Clinton and her allies are set to hit Trump with nearly $50 million worth of swing state advertising in the coming weeks, but his campaign has no ad plan to fight back.  The constellation of super PACs wishing to support Trump isn t able to fill the void, largely because the monthslong war for control between Manafort and Lewandowski led to an effective freeze in their activity. Trump s fundraising operation   once overseen by Lewandowski   is also lagging. While Clinton and her affiliated outside organizations have raised roughly $300 million, the presumptive GOP nominee s operation is just beginning to get off the ground. High-ranking Republicans   as well as Trump s long-standing critics   have expressed surprise and dismay at the lack of organization in Trump s ranks, which they fear is likely to damage the party s down-ballot prospects.  The idea that firing a staffer shows some kind of competence when your advertising, your campaign infrastructure, your data infrastructure, the offensive nature of your rhetoric, your campaign is a dumpster fire and it s not because of one staffer, it s because of the candidate,  said Rory Cooper, a senior adviser to Never Trump PAC.   This is not a real campaign to begin with.  They have a half-dozen people and are relying on the RNC to do almost all of the heavy lifting that a normal campaign does, which is near impossible, especially when the RNC is going to have to focus on protecting the House and Senate seats that Donald Trump puts in danger.  Until recently, the Trump campaign was able to fend off such criticism by pointing to the success of the campaign s unorthodox approach during the primary season and Trump s unprecedented ability to command the news cycle. But the GOP s get-it-together chorus grew louder and more insistent in recent days as Trump s national polling deficit against Clinton grew to 6 points in the RealClearPolitics average as of Monday   twice as much as Obama s over Mitt Romney in June 2012   and his unfavorable ratings hit record-breaking levels. All of it has occurred against the backdrop of several weeks of nonstop controversy surrounding Trump s suggestion that an Indiana-born judge of Mexican heritage would be unfair to him because of his proposal to build a border wall   and his refusal to back off the remarks   and Trump s self-congratulatory response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. To many Republicans, the two episodes reflected a lack of discipline and a political tone-deafness that could be deadly in the general election.  Trump s campaign is in free fall.  There is not a single aspect of the campaign that is in good shape; he has messaging, finance, political, organizational problems and on the current trajectory, he will suffer an embarrassing defeat this fall,  said Alex Conant, former communications director for the Marco Rubio campaign.   Effectively, [Trump doesn t have a campaign.    He s had two months now to consolidate conservative support, and aside from one or two symbolic actions like the NRA speech and the list of judges, both of which he subsequently undermined, he s done nothing to unite Republicans, and I think arguably his standing among Republicans is worse than it was a month ago.  Lewandowski s sudden dismissal was a clear move to put an end to such hand-wringing and frustration.  It was the New Hampshire native, after all, who was the campaign s biggest proponent of Trump s shoot-from-the-hip style.  He clashed repeatedly with Manafort over the latter s insistence that the candidate act more  presidential    a suggestion that Trump himself bristled against at times, figuring he d gotten far enough without dramatically altering his campaign-trail persona. An alum of the Koch brothers  Americans for Prosperity network, Lewandowski ran the Trump operation despite having no presidential campaign experience.  Although he managed to guide Trump to the nomination, his large paychecks and his decision to travel constantly with the candidate raised eyebrows, and his hard-charging style made him a polarizing character.  He drew the most fire when he was charged   but not ultimately convicted   in Florida with simple battery for grabbing a reporter, praising Trump s loyalty to him throughout the saga. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Lewandowski had been locked in an ugly power struggle with Manafort, a veteran GOP operative and former business partner of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone who joined the campaign in late March.  As Manafort urged Trump to take a more professional tone and approach to the campaign, and while Trump s children   themselves advisers   started to clash with Lewandowski as well, the campaign manager found his role fluctuating.  Corey was there from the beginning, worked with Donald, traveled with him every day, and so Donald had given him wide latitude.  The problem is once you ve gone past the nomination, he s never been involved in a national campaign.  It s not his fault if he didn t know what to do,  said Charlie Black, a veteran Republican operative who handled convention strategy for Ohio Gov.  John Kasich and used to work with Stone and Manafort.   It s a huge difference.  Look, it s a miracle they got through the primary process with one press person.  You can t do a general election campaign without a communications operation.    Whenever there s divided leadership headed in different directions, you need to resolve it and put somebody in charge, and it s to Donald s credit that he did.  When the final ax came down on Monday, some of the internal campaign tensions burst into the open.  Ding dong the witch is dead,  tweeted Michael Caputo, a campaign adviser who leads the operation in New York, linking to the song from  The Wizard of Oz.  Caputo resigned later in the day in a letter to Manafort, expressing regret for his  too exuberant  reaction. Lewandowski, engaging in some damage control after his ouster, insisted there was no bad blood between him and Manafort.  When Paul [Manafort first came in, he was going to manage the delegate process.  And then we were fortunate enough to secure enough delegates that we didn t need a delegate manager.  Since that time, Paul and I have gotten along amazingly well, and I know the media doesn t want to report that, but we work side by side, talking on a daily basis, multiple times a day,  he said on CNN Monday.   He had his roles which he was going to oversee on the campaign.  I had a very separate function, which included making sure that Mr.  Trump s schedule goes accordingly   there was no animosity between Paul and I.  Lewandowski isn t going away.  He s set to rise again next month   as the leader of New Hampshire s delegation to the national convention.  NEW YORK   Big Wall Street donors have a message for Hillary Clinton: Keep Elizabeth Warren off the ticket or risk losing millions of dollars in contributions. In a dozen interviews, major Democratic donors in the financial services industry said they saw little chance that Clinton would pick the liberal firebrand as her vice presidential nominee.  These donors despise Warren s attacks on the financial industry.  But they also think her selection would be damaging to the economy.  And they warned that if Clinton surprises them and taps Warren, big donations from the industry could vanish.  If Clinton picked Warren, her whole base on Wall Street would leave her,  said one top Democratic donor who has helped raise millions for Clinton.   They would literally just say,  We have no qualms with you moving left, we understand all the things you ve had to do because of Bernie Sanders, but if you are going there with Warren, we just can t trust you, you ve killed it.   Most big donors don t want Warren on the ticket because she is the most accomplished anti-Wall Street populist in the Democratic Party.  But many also think her presence would drive a potential Clinton administration too far to the left, poison relations with the private sector from the start and ultimately be damaging to the economy. A constant theme that emerged in the interviews is that executives in the financial industry believe the first 100 days of a Clinton administration could feature potential deal making with Republicans, who are likely to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. The dream deal for Wall Street would be a combination of targeted infrastructure spending that appeals mostly to Democrats and corporate and international tax reform that could bring Republicans along.  The fear is that Warren would make such a deal more difficult.  Clinton is going to face a divided government unless there is a total tsunami,  said one moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry.   What you want in a vice president is someone who can negotiate for you on the Hill, someone like Joe Biden.  And that is not a Warren strength.  All of the donors and senior Democrats interviewed for this story demanded that their names not be used both because they were not authorized to speak about the Clinton campaign s internal deliberations and because they feared Warren s wrath.   There is no upside to my talking to you on the record,  one big donor said.   Either I piss off the Clinton campaign or I piss off Warren, or both.  Several donors said they did not really fear Warren going on the ticket because they do not believe Clinton has a strong relationship with the senator and would not trust Warren to be a loyal No.  2, either on the campaign or in the White House.  First of all, they don t particularly like each other,  said one prominent hedge fund manager who has raised millions for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton before her.  But, the manager added,  The absolute predicate for a vice presidential nominee is they have to understand they are No.  2 both during the campaign and once you take office, and I just don t think Elizabeth Warren is that type of person.  The distaste for Warren in the banking industry is not surprising.  No American politician in recent history has done more to harness the powerful anti-Wall Street sentiment that continues to rage in the country since the financial crisis of 2008. Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that many bankers dislike, and she continues to push for far stronger regulations including breaking up the nation s largest financial institutions into smaller, simpler pieces.  This is exactly the reason that many on the left, including ardent backers of Sen.  Bernie Sanders  presidential campaign, want to see Warren on the ticket.  It s very clear that Wall Street guys don t like her because she has been a lot more effective than most in communicating an anti-Wall Street message that has been part of the Democratic Party for 80 years, since the 1930s,  said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College.   It s not so much that Wall Street doesn t like her personally, most of them don t even know her, but they don t like anyone that espouses that particular ideology.  A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment for this story.  A representative of Warren did not respond to requests for comment. Clinton earlier this month said she thinks Warren is  qualified  to be vice president.   I have the highest regard for Sen.  Warren,  she said in an interview with Politico.   I think she is an incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role.  I look forward to working with her on behalf of not only the campaign and her very effective critique of [Donald Trump, but also on the issues that she and I both care about.  Warren has maintained the typical stance of potential vice presidents, saying she is perfectly happy in her current job.  But she has some powerful backers pushing Clinton to pick her for the vice-presidential slot, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev. ). People close to the Clinton campaign say that while Warren might not wind up as the vice-presidential selection, Wall Street executives are dead wrong to think that it couldn t happen. They say Warren is very high on the list of possible vice presidential candidates along with Sens.  Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli n Castro; and Rep.  Xavier Becerra of California, among others.   We are not at the point of ruling anyone in or out,  a person close to the process said. Picking Warren would be risky for Clinton s fundraising operation.  The presumptive Democratic nominee hopes to raise $1. 5 billion for her campaign against Trump, and Wall Street has been a big source of funding for her over the years. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton and outside groups supporting her have raised $289 million so far in the 2016 cycle.  The securities and investment industry is easily Clinton s top source of cash, donating over $28 million so far, according to the CRP.  Things are so volatile now with all of the outside groups that all it can take is pissing off one billionaire on Wall Street to make it difficult,  said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the CRP.   And you don t run national campaigns for as many years as Clinton has without some serious support from Wall Street, they are just too much of a heavy hitter.  The progressive case for Warren holds that she would immediately energize the liberal base and bring Sanders voters into the fold.  And Warren backers note that the senator has been an early and enthusiastic basher of Trump and shown a knack for getting under the presumptive GOP presidential nominee s skin.  Elizabeth Warren very effectively called out Donald Trump for cheering the Wall Street collapse because it would make him money   and that moment reminded Democrats how powerful Warren s megaphone can be,  said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.   Whether it s as vice president or as co-chair of the presidential transition committee, it s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton not wanting a very large role for Elizabeth Warren at the table.  But more moderate Democrats in the financial services industry argue that Sanders voters will come on board anyway and that Clinton does not need to pick Warren to help her win.  We are going to win this.  Trump shouldn t be president and he isn t going to be president,  said one senior executive at a Wall Street bank who is close to Clinton.   Picking Warren would indicate weakness and panic for no reason and make them look like they are running scared of Trump.  There will be plenty of time to galvanize the left and get them to come out.  And Warren would be a nightmare to try and manage.  Another argument against putting Warren on the ticket is that she can be just as effective a surrogate while maintaining her power base in the Senate.  In the current era of presidential politics, social media has allowed more people to assume the role of attack dog that was traditionally left to the vice-presidential nominee,  said Jason Rosenstock, an analyst at Thorn Run Partners who covers the financial industry.   Warren has shown an excellence in the platform that would allow her to help the campaign incredibly while maintaining her growing position of power in the Senate.  On the economic front, some moderate Democrats and financial executives worry that having Warren as vice president would poison relationships between business and the White House from the beginning of a potential Hillary Clinton administration. These people say there is an opportunity for much better relations between business and the White House than during President Barack Obama s tenure, as well as more effective deal making with Congress to avoid the kind of fiscal crises that damaged the economy the past six years.  In addition to cutting deals on taxes and infrastructure, Wall Street worries about the return of the debt ceiling as a potentially big issue in 2016, as well as the return of sequester spending cuts.  There is going to be a lot to deal with in the first 100 days, and I m not sure going left and picking Warren would be particularly helpful,  said a top financial services lobbyist in Washington. This Democrat, along with several Wall Street donors mentioned Kaine as the ideal vice-presidential pick.  The Virginia Democrat comes from a key swing state, is fluent in Spanish, sits on the Armed Services Committee and is generally palatable to both progressives and more business-friendly Democrats.  He checks every box,  the moderate Washington Democrat with close ties to the banking industry said.   You could see him step in as president, he is credible with the base of the party, and he s also comfortable spending time with the rich people you need to raise money from.                   Donald Trump speaks at the Saint Andelm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire June 13.   Did he say anything? I had been interviewing a source, and I couldn t take my cellphone out of my pocket every time it buzzed.  So for 20 minutes, I was cut off from the outside world, I was cut off from him.  I was cut off from my Trump fix.  No Twitter.  No texts.  No websites.  No cable TV.  My palms were sweaty.  My heart was pounding.  Anything could have happened.  So I fired up my iPhone and checked Twitter.  The New York Times had the scoop:  Donald Trump Parts Ways With Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager.   Then there was this attack-tweet from Hillary Clinton s chief strategist Joel Benenson:  Polls drop.  Trump dumps mgr.  S.  Beckett:  There s man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet.    S.  Beckett refers to Samuel Beckett, an Irish playwright and Nobel Prize winner, who is currently dead.  The quotation came from Beckett s play  Waiting for Godot,  which debuted in 1953.  In it, people sit around and talk and talk while accomplishing virtually nothing.  The play is, in other words, a metaphor for modern presidential campaigning.  The Trump campaign officially tweeted:  The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.   This is standard pol-speak for:  Don t let the door hit you in the butt on your way out and if you try to steal any Sharpies, you will be arrested and beaten.   The Politico story quoted a senior Trump aide as saying that  Lewandowski was not getting along with the Republican National Committee, that there was a recognition that the campaign was falling behind Hillary Clinton from an infrastructure perspective and that there was recognition that Lewandowski was no longer up to the job.   In addition, there must have been a heck of a lot of Sharpies missing.  The story dominated cable, with CNN reporting that Ivanka Trump, Donald s oldest daughter, had a one-on-one meeting with her father over the weekend and demanded that Lewandowski be dumped.  Given the choice of picking a new campaign manager or picking a new oldest daughter, Trump went with Ivanka.  But getting rid of Lewandowski did serve one positive purpose.  It changed the Trump  story of the day    there always has to be at least one   away from a speech in which Trump had said:  Belgium is a beautiful city.   It is not.  And I don t need some Irish Nobel Prize winner to tell me that.  All I need is a map of Europe.  Belgium is a country.  Brussels, its capital, is a city.  Both begin with the letter  b,  which is why Trump ran into trouble.  He majored in screwing other people on bad deals, not geography.  So dumping Lewandowski, embarrassing as it was, gave the media something else to write about.  Like how embarrassing Trump s running mate is going to be.  Take Newt Gingrich.  Please.  Rick Tyler, a former Ted Cruz spokesman who was fired in February for posting fake tweets and Facebook entries about Marco Rubio   are you following all this?   said recently:  I don t know two other people who can command more media attention than Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump.  Keeping your enemies constantly on defense, constantly off balance, constantly explaining themselves.  Newt knows how to do that.   Newt also knows how to make news.  Like when he advocated building a permanent base on the moon by the end of his second presidential term and using the base for manned flights to Mars.  This is exactly the kind of vice president Trump needs.  It lets him say,  I might be nuts, but Newt is bat-poo crazy.  So don t even dream of impeaching me.   What Hillary needs to learn from all this is how to go on the offense against Trump.  She has to be proactive instead of reactive.  She has to make people say,  Did she say anything? Did I miss anything Hillary said?  And there are signs she is beginning to get it.  A few weeks ago, Hillary jumped all over Trump.   Donald Trump s ideas aren t just different   they are dangerously incoherent,  Clinton said.   They re not really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.   Trump reacted with typical aplomb: which is to say, he went into a series of bizarre rants.   I have a strong temperament, and it s a very good temperament and it s a very in control temperament or I wouldn t have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn t have built all of the things that I ve been able to do in life!  he spluttered.   I mean, No.  1 best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success.    Uh, television,  The Apprentice,  which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly, you have no idea.   Yes, we have no idea.  On Wednesday, Trump will fly to Scotland and then to Ireland to show off his golf courses there.  He is scheduled to return to America on Saturday.  Which leaves us with one big question: Should we let him back in? Roger Simon is POLITICO's chief political columnist.

Podcast produced by Bridget Mulcahy.  PHOENIX   Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a  Happy Birthday  message.  Did he get in touch?  the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied,  no,  but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email.  A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite I love Sheriff Joe!It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14   but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens. Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate.  They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny  political correctness  of minority groups.  Arpaio hit on the formula first   adding a Korean War veteran s fondness for accumulating . 50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance   but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick.   I don t like people to say,  He s copying you,   Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast. As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does   but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence. During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others? Why would I bite the hand that feeds?  he said, shaking his head in disapproval. In Arpaio s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him.   I'm controversial,  he added with a shrug.   You wouldn't be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I don't think.  (In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed   he had the medical bills.  In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3. 75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriff's real estate transactions. )(Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York s tabloids.  Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being  controversial  was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation.  Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he s  strictly a self-made madman.  He s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news.  He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn t so bad ( there wasn't that much crime when the mob   now, I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too.  . . .  They will never kill a child or a cop, OK? ). He knew I was Jewish, so I got this:  Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security.  I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people.  I'm not just saying that because you're Jewish.  Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point.   The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky,  he added.   I don't know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money.  Actually, I'm the only one that ever busted that guy.  Do you know that?  (I did not. )Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus.  When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea   thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter   that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy. Whether it s gays, ISIS   there s one other [thing} that nobody is talking about.  Everybody there happened to be Latino.  Why?   because that was a night for Latino and Cuban,  he told me.   Why didn t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn t like it? Come on.  You re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS.  What about Hispanics? Why isn t anybody   why hasn t the news media even asked that question? Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded.  He was undeterred.  It could be because there is talk around the nation   there s a lot of people that don t like Hispanics.  Is that a secret?  he added. In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics. Oh, and he used county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama s  fake  birth certificate.  (An Arpaio-allied group later tried to reimburse the county for the expense but was rebuffed by the board of supervisors. ) That s what got him his first give- em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump.   That s not dead as far as I m concerned,  he told me. But beneath the bombast, there s a whisper of a showman s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump.  It s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician s power is ultimately derived from the news media   and when they turn on you, look out.  I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.   You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is.  That s the way it is in politics.  Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man s Donald Trump   same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio s life story he s the poor (or at last the working-class) man.  His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump s partial snub.  On June 14, 1932, Arpaio s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him.  His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store.  And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else s dinner table until his father remarried.  Eighty-four times   you have to look back at your life,  he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career   the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the  Trumpinator  at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood.   I never had a mother to grow up with, but that s the way it is.  . . .  It was a little difficult sometimes when you don t have a mother and you're bounced from one Italian family to another.  Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites.  Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country   a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself. The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino   a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics.  In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a  Make Maricopa Great Again  campaign.  Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer. Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment   and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control   has the same knack.   Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him,  he told me.   Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.  But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field.  He s running again this year and blames the Obama administration s campaign against his policies for the drop.  But local analysts noted a telling shift   support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age. Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over  out of spite.   He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration s racial profiling case   he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.  I think it's overstated,  he said.   I think there's a lot of hype.  Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say.  We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines.  So everybody has to be very careful.   You don't think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point?  I asked. His answer:  No.  No.  No, I really don t.  When I pointed out that many critics had called him  a racist,  he waved dismissively.  When they can't get you for anything else, it's a famous word,  racist,   he said.   Do you think it bothers me? It doesn't really bother me.  I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want.  . . .  [I m probably one guy that really doesn t [discriminate, you know, and I m not going to say my best friend is black.  . . .  No, no, no.  And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican.  I got all these family   but I m not going to say that.  I guess you could still have that and say you re a racist, you know, but no.  I know what I am.  Come on.  He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two ( he s got my underwear ) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate s claim of a  silent majority  that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters. Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.  All these politicians afraid to go near him,  he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.  I think everybody is looking at their own elections.  I hate to say that,  Arpaio added.   You know it; I know it.  You want me to say it, and I'm saying it.  . . .  People have to worry about their own future, their own elections.  I understand that.  But I'm not the type of guy that does that.  I don't throw people under the bus.  I know there s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote.  People are always saying,  Oh, you can t win if you don't have the Hispanic vote.   He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.  If there's anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it s me, with all the heat I m taking, right?  he said.   Any smart guy would do that, but I m not a smart guy, maybe.   PHOENIX   Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a  Happy Birthday  message.  Did he get in touch?  the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied,  no,  but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email.  A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite I love Sheriff Joe!It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14   but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens. Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate.  They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny  political correctness  of minority groups.  Arpaio hit on the formula first   adding a Korean War veteran s fondness for accumulating . 50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance   but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick.   I don t like people to say,  He s copying you,   Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast. As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does   but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence. During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others? Why would I bite the hand that feeds?  he said, shaking his head in disapproval. In Arpaio s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him.   I'm controversial,  he added with a shrug.   You wouldn't be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I don't think.  (In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed   he had the medical bills.  In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3. 75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriff's real estate transactions. )(Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York s tabloids.  Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being  controversial  was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation.  Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he s  strictly a self-made madman.  He s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news.  He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn t so bad ( there wasn't that much crime when the mob   now, I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too.  . . .  They will never kill a child or a cop, OK? ). He knew I was Jewish, so I got this:  Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security.  I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people.  I'm not just saying that because you're Jewish.  Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point.   The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky,  he added.   I don't know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money.  Actually, I'm the only one that ever busted that guy.  Do you know that?  (I did not. )Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus.  When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea   thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter   that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy. Whether it s gays, ISIS   there s one other [thing} that nobody is talking about.  Everybody there happened to be Latino.  Why?   because that was a night for Latino and Cuban,  he told me.   Why didn t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn t like it? Come on.  You re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS.  What about Hispanics? Why isn t anybody   why hasn t the news media even asked that question? Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded.  He was undeterred.  It could be because there is talk around the nation   there s a lot of people that don t like Hispanics.  Is that a secret?  he added. In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics. Oh, and he used county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama s  fake  birth certificate.  (An Arpaio-allied group later tried to reimburse the county for the expense but was rebuffed by the board of supervisors. ) That s what got him his first give- em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump.   That s not dead as far as I m concerned,  he told me. But beneath the bombast, there s a whisper of a showman s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump.  It s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician s power is ultimately derived from the news media   and when they turn on you, look out.  I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.   You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is.  That s the way it is in politics.  Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man s Donald Trump   same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio s life story he s the poor (or at last the working-class) man.  His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump s partial snub.  On June 14, 1932, Arpaio s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him.  His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store.  And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else s dinner table until his father remarried.  Eighty-four times   you have to look back at your life,  he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career   the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the  Trumpinator  at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood.   I never had a mother to grow up with, but that s the way it is.  . . .  It was a little difficult sometimes when you don t have a mother and you're bounced from one Italian family to another.  Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites.  Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country   a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself. The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino   a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics.

Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer.

House Republicans on a powerful spending committee rejected an amendment to limit the sale of firearms to terrorist suspects Wednesday, just days after Senate Republicans blocked an identical amendment on the chamber floor.  This policy could have made areal difference in Orlando,  said Rep.  Nita Lowey (D-N. Y. ), who introduced the amendment during a House Appropriations Committee mark up.  The measure would block firearms purchases by those who the Attorney General has a  reasonable suspicion  are engaged in terrorism. Republicans said the provision would violate due process rights for those seeking to buy firearms.  Democrats fired back by reciting the names and stories of some of the 49 victims of the June 12 massacre in Orlando, arguing that new gun controls are the best way to stop future bloodshed. After pointed back-and-forth, the measure was defeated, 16-31.  This list has been faulted for producing a high error rate in the past,  said Rep.  John Carter (R-Texas) of the terror watch list, urging his colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I cannot support a standard that is so inherently subjective, especially when it is used to deny a constitutional right.   But Democrats focused on the stories of some of Omar Mateen's victims in Orlando. Lowey spoke about Shane Tomlinson, 33, who was from her district.  He made everyone around him better.  His life was cut far too short,  she said.   He will be sorely missed but not forgotten.   Rep.  Jose Serrano (D-N. Y. ) spoke about Jonathan Antonio Camuy Vega, 24.  He had his whole life ahead of him,  Serrano said.   All his hopes, his dreams, his life gone in an instant.   Some Republican members compared the proposed measure to the internment of Japanese citizens by the US government during WWII, addressing such comparisons to Rep.  Mike Honda (D-Cal. ), who spent time in such an internment camp with his family.   Your liberty should never have been denied, and we shouldn t deny people s Second Amendment rights either,  Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) said to Honda, who disputed the comparison.   The government, I think, said they had  reasonable suspicion,  and therefore you were denied some rights, on the basis of  reasonable suspicion,   appropriations chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky. ) said to Honda, arguing that such reasonable suspicion should not be allowed to deny the right to purchase firearm. Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats for trampling on the constitution. Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) slammed the measure as taking away  one of the most fundamental rights Americans have.  Rep.  Andy Harris (R-Md. ) called the right to own a firearm  almost the definition of personal liberty.

Republicans who cannot support Donald Trump as the party's nominee should skip next month's convention in Cleveland, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday, tearing into factions of the party for appearing ignorant of national and even global political attitudes. You know, if you can t vote for the nominee of the party and the person who got the votes, don t go to the convention, Gingrich said during a Facebook livestream on a trip to Hungary with his wife, Callista.  Don t think you can safely get away with imposing your values, your judgment, your wisdom on the people of the United States.  That era s over, and in fact, you re going to look very foolish arguing that the voters   your voters   back home don t count because you re so much smarter. Even as Republicans have lamented the Democratic superdelegate process as hurting Bernie Sanders, Gingrich remarked that some of our friends want to create elite delegates in the Republican Party. An elite delegate is a person who says,  You know, I m so smart and my judgment s so good, I don t care what the voters back home say.  I don t care who they voted for.  You re telling me that Donald Trump got 13. 5 million votes, I don t care.  You tell me it s the most votes any Republican has ever got, I don t care.  After all, why should I listen to the people when I have my elitist superior wisdom,' Gingrich said, characterizing the position of a Republican opposed to Trump. That is not likely to go well, Gingrich said, urging his fellow party members to not decide that you re smarter than the American people. While House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) said he would not advocate for members of his party to violate their conscience in supporting Trump, Gingrich continued, he has also said the presumptive Republican nominee won this thing fair and square. Voters could have picked Cruz, Marco Rubio (whose decision to run for Senate re-election earned Gingrich's praise) or John Kasich, the former speaker said, but fact is, they didn t. Now for people to come along and say,  you know, I don t actually care what the Republican voters say,  cause I m going to impose my elite position, my superior wisdom,' Let me tell ya, Gingrich warned.  That is exactly what the country is rebelling against, that is exactly the attitude that led to the victory of the two women reformers in Italy this week, that s exactly the attitude that crushed the two traditional parties in Austria a couple weeks ago, he said, referring to recent European elections delivering a jolt to the establishment.

We're having a remarkable trip, Gingrich said, as the feed ended.                  Marco Rubio becomes the immediate frontrunner in a battleground race that Democrats had been slightly favored to win.   In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an 11th-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant frontrunner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election was too important for the GOP to potentially lose control of the Senate over.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn't hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a civil-fraud trial against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American whose experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments concerning the judge.  I most certainly strongly disagree and I found what he said offensive and I m glad he stopped saying it,  Rubio added. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Once virtually tied, Trump is now trailing Clinton by 8 points in the poll, which showed that 58 percent of voters thought his comments about the  Mexican  judge were racist.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Democrats didn t want to face Rubio in the general election and had hoped he would keep his promise and retire in January. But they see an upside.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democrats, and the GOP appears divided as its favored Senate candidate criticizes its presidential nominee.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it will critically damage his political career and make a 2020 White House bid far more difficult.  Obviously this is a decision he had to make,  said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Jon Tester of Montana.   I think that anytime you run for a position that s a fallback position, that s not good.  I think he has to explain the votes he missed, I think he has to explain why, after a mass shooting in Orlando, that he votes against a bill that would help stop that from happening. Other than that it s fine, Tester added sarcastically. Rubio dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  Patrick Murphy is someone who is not prepared to be U. S.  senator considering the magnitude of what we re facing now,  Rubio said.   He has no significant achievements in his entire life.  He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  In discussing Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation into a hedge fund he ran and suggested the Orlando congressman was corrupt.  Alan Grayson, if he were elected, the chances are he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office,  Rubio said.   He has huge ethical issues.  Both Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He has a right to run.  And we ll have a campaign.  I can tell you that in the Florida primary, the only person that supported Charlie Crist after he changed parties was him,  Rubio said.   So he ll have to answer for that.  Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate seat or seek reelection. Asked if he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  I m coming back to the Senate with full energy because I believe that our next senator has to be someone that, no matter who s elected president, will encourage them to make the right decisions and stand up to them when they re making the wrong decisions   even if they re from your own party.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most-unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most-competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  Rubio said. As Democrats looked more likely to take his seat, Rubio said he didn t want to be responsible for Sen.  Chuck Schumer becoming majority leader and allowing Clinton s Supreme Court nominees to sail through the Senate if she wins the presidency. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings June 12 when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling to fundraise and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he uns for president again. As for the weeks of rumors that he and Lopez-Cantera had struck a deal for him to get in the race before the Orlando shootings, Rubio said they were  completely false.   As evidence of that, Rubio has no ready campaign that he can unveil, although most of the former campaign workers from his 2016 presidential bid are ready to help out. Clint Reed will be Rubio s campaign manager and Todd Harris will serve as a strategic advisor to the campaign.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan will either work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential election bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the race.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio's decision moved the seat from a likely loss to an almost certain pick-up. It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority so it's a big development, McConnell said.  I'm just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had . . .  I'm pretty excited about itBut Rubio s fellow Florida Senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election.   He and I get along real well (but) I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect,  Nelson said.   I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.                   Marco Rubio becomes the immediate frontrunner in a battleground race that Democrats had been slightly favored to win.   In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an 11th-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant frontrunner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election was too important for the GOP to potentially lose control of the Senate over.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn't hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a civil-fraud trial against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American whose experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments concerning the judge.  I most certainly strongly disagree and I found what he said offensive and I m glad he stopped saying it,  Rubio added. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Once virtually tied, Trump is now trailing Clinton by 8 points in the poll, which showed that 58 percent of voters thought his comments about the  Mexican  judge were racist.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Democrats didn t want to face Rubio in the general election and had hoped he would keep his promise and retire in January. But they see an upside.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democrats, and the GOP appears divided as its favored Senate candidate criticizes its presidential nominee.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it will critically damage his political career and make a 2020 White House bid far more difficult.  Obviously this is a decision he had to make,  said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Jon Tester of Montana.   I think that anytime you run for a position that s a fallback position, that s not good.  I think he has to explain the votes he missed, I think he has to explain why, after a mass shooting in Orlando, that he votes against a bill that would help stop that from happening. Other than that it s fine, Tester added sarcastically. Rubio dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  Patrick Murphy is someone who is not prepared to be U. S.  senator considering the magnitude of what we re facing now,  Rubio said.   He has no significant achievements in his entire life.  He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  In discussing Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation into a hedge fund he ran and suggested the Orlando congressman was corrupt.  Alan Grayson, if he were elected, the chances are he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office,  Rubio said.   He has huge ethical issues.  Both Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He has a right to run.

I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.                   Former Trump adviser Michael Caputo said the Trump campaign is now positive and optimistic.   Donald Trump's crisply argued, largely teleprompter-reliant speech taking down Hillary Clinton is a positive sign of things to come, the presumptive Republican nominee's former adviser Michael Caputo said Wednesday. Affirming that he still supports Trump despite his resignation after tweeting Ding Dong the witch is dead! following news of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's firing, Caputo told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports that the campaign's changes have created the most positive, the most optimistic moment in the Trump campaign since its loss in the Wisconsin primary in early April. I think people on Capitol Hill that you were talking about earlier, the folks who watching the campaign very closely, are about to see the kind of campaign that Donald Trump really deserves, Caputo said, adding that the slow start in fundraising might be revealing a little mechanical lag.  Things are going to turn around very quickly. Asked whether Trump needs to be better staffed and more careful about the charges he is lobbing against Clinton, as well as whether the candidate has a responsibility to be more precise, Caputo bristled. I think you'll see more and more precision in his speeches as we go forward.  You'll see more and more of the teleprompter coming out front.  But just because David Brock's Hillary Clinton PAC sends you corrections to Donald Trump doesn't mean he's always on the up and up either, Caputo said, in reference to rapid-response emails from the Clinton ally's Correct the Record.  We'll all going to be fact checked through this process.  I look forward to fact checking Hillary Clinton, too, and I hope you'll pay just as much attention to her.

Valerie Jarrett speaks on a stage at the White House Summit on the United State of Women on June 14.   Valerie Jarrett is increasingly asserting control of the administration s campaign to curtail gun violence   and she s not afraid of burning White House bridges with firearm manufacturers as she does it. Even before the latest massacre in Orlando, it was Jarrett who used her influence with President Barack Obama to resurrect the push for new regulations, gun control advocates say.  But since that shooting, she s employed a more aggressive strategy than did Vice President Joe Biden, whose consensus-building efforts failed to produce new laws three years ago. Take a recent White House bid to collaborate with weapons manufacturers on so-called  smart guns,  which make it impossible for anyone other than an authorized user to fire a weapon   and should be fertile ground for a relatively noncontroversial compromise. But after 30 industry executives refused to show up for a meeting last Friday, Jarrett decided to mobilize nearly 200,000 supporters behind a new assault weapons ban, which industry vehemently opposes and would take a best-seller off the shelves.  While it didn t slam the door on further negotiations, it s the kind of move that would make any future talks much more difficult. With Biden dispatched in search of a cure for cancer, and Obama demanding an end to the bloodshed, Jarrett   Obama's closest friend and conscience in the West Wing   is focused not only on measures like background checks, which are much easier to sell to Congress, at least compared with an assault weapons ban.  Jarrett is also executing Obama s call to  politicize  the issue during his last year in office and crank up the pressure on reluctant lawmakers.  Please keep making your voices heard.  Raise them over and over and over and over and over again,  Jarrett said on Monday in an unusual conference call, which was intended for the people who signed a  We the People  petition to ban the AR-15 but was broadcast live on YouTube for anyone to listen.  I ve had people say to me,  Well, I enjoy going to the firing range and using the assault weapons,   Jarrett said.   But the pleasure derived from that compared to the horrendous damage that it can do, we believe that the damage warrants banning assault weapons.  In the wake of the Orlando massacre, which involved a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, both Obama and Biden have made clear that, as Biden put it in his written response to the AR-15 petition, assault weapons  should be banned from civilian ownership.   But Biden focused his message to Congress on passing the background check and terror watch list bills that failed in the Senate on Monday. Jarrett went further:  There s no reason why Congress could not reauthorize legislation that would call for that ban.   And stoking support for the assault weapons ban with activists will likely intensify the political fight ahead of the 2016 elections. Previously, Obama put Biden in charge of crafting the administration s response to the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shootings, and the vice president still serves a prominent role as sympathizer-in-chief.  But since his effort ran aground, gun control advocates say, it s been Jarrett who s most effectively pushed for action over the past year despite congressional gridlock.  As the months went by and ideas were discussed and priorities came and went, she was a constant source of influence in the building making sure that the process was moving forward,  said Peter Ambler, director at Americans for Responsible Solutions.  When the group s co-founders, former Rep.  Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, proposed new executive actions during a January 2015 meeting with Obama and Jarrett in Phoenix, Ambler recalled, the president turned to his senior adviser to make them happen.  He announced new directives to expand background checks a year later.   I don t think that there is an individual at the White House except for the president who can claim more responsibility for the successes of the executive actions than Valerie Jarrett,  Ambler said. To be sure, top aides in the White House Counsel and Chief of Staff s office also played pivotal roles in developing the latest round of executive actions.  Biden is still playing a key part, too, though he's increasingly turned his attention to his  Cancer Moonshot.   People in the West Wing say his close relationship with police   forged in the mid-1990s during his work on the crime bill   has been especially valuable.  Just last month, for example, he opened a meeting with law enforcement officials that was supposed to be about criminal justice reform with a pointed pitch for smart guns.  And as the architect of the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban and original background check bill, he s got substantial credibility with activists, especially those driven by grief.   I refuse to give up, we refuse to give up,  Biden said on Wednesday at a Washington fundraiser for Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention group founded by parents of the first-graders gunned down at the elementary school.  It took me seven years to get the first ban put in place,  said Biden, who had argued that the administration should prioritize guns even before the Newtown shooting.   We should not stop.  But as the audience waited for Biden to come to the podium, Jarrett was in the back of the room, deep in conversation, as her top aides   Paulette Aniskoff, Bess Evans and Yohannes Abraham   circulated through the crowd.  It was those aides, in Jarrett s Office of Public Engagement, who have gradually taken on the bulk of the gun portfolio over the past three years, even as they continue to collaborate with Biden s staff. The portfolio has been something of an orphan in the Obama administration, with no obvious point person, particularly after the legislation Biden was working on failed in April 2013, and Bruce Reed, who had run an exhaustive series of outreach and strategy sessions with gun control advocates in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, stepped down as Biden s chief of staff in late 2013. Jarrett brought it back into the West Wing   and out to the statehouses, advocates said, by making it a priority for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.  In May, for example, Jarrett presided over a White House strategy session on enacting local laws to expand background checks and promote gun safety technology with elected officials from 48 states, featuring a peptalk keynote from Biden. In his search for progress after Newtown, Biden and his staff famously met with, as he put it,  every possible stakeholder in this debate; 229 separate groups,  in just a few months.  They settled on expanding background checks, a measure that s hovered above 80 percent public approval since 2013.  The bill failed in the Senate then, and an updated version failed on Monday, 56 to 44. Meeting with stakeholders is also a raison d etre of Jarrett s office.  Part of the Valerie Jarrett portfolio is working with the many constituencies that have a stake in the issues that matter most, and one of those has become the family members of victims of shootings,  said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on gun policy. Jarrett herself is in that category: She s recounted how her grandfather was killed with his own gun when burglars broke into his office. The administration still take pains to stress their support for the Second Amendment right for individual gun ownership.  During Jarrett s call, among the questions hand-picked by staff was asking why  you trying to disarm  citizens.   We wouldn t take a gun away from a law-abiding citizen,  Jarrett insisted.  We wouldn t take a gun away from anyone.  The National Rifle Association disputes that.  A spokeswoman for the gun rights group said that banning an entire class of firearms is, by definition, taking guns from law-abiding citizens. She was trying the approach of outreach to skeptics before a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, when her focus was on smart guns.  The administration is working to get buy-in from police for the technology, in hopes of creating a new market; earlier this month, the Department of Justice hosted law enforcement officials to talk about how smart guns might work for their departments. Manufacturers have expressed some openness to smart guns   they could be a whole new sales category, after all   but they fear any sort of government mandate, as well as backlash from gun rights groups. So weeks before the Orlando shooting, Jarrett and chief of staff Denis McDonough invited executives from about 30 gunmakers to the White House.  They declined, according to an industry executive, because they perceived the invitation as  disingenuous.    Jarrett lashed out at the gun lobby in her call.  The NRA over the past 7  years has never been willing to come to the table and work with us,  she said.  (Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.

She was trying the approach of outreach to skeptics before a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, when her focus was on smart guns.  The administration is working to get buy-in from police for the technology, in hopes of creating a new market; earlier this month, the Department of Justice hosted law enforcement officials to talk about how smart guns might work for their departments. Manufacturers have expressed some openness to smart guns   they could be a whole new sales category, after all   but they fear any sort of government mandate, as well as backlash from gun rights groups. So weeks before the Orlando shooting, Jarrett and chief of staff Denis McDonough invited executives from about 30 gunmakers to the White House.  They declined, according to an industry executive, because they perceived the invitation as  disingenuous.    Jarrett lashed out at the gun lobby in her call.  The NRA over the past 7  years has never been willing to come to the table and work with us,  she said.  (Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.                  A fundraising email from the Trump campaign said they raised $2 million in 12 hours.   Donald Trump Jr.  said Wednesday the Trump campaign raised $2 million in 12 hours. In an email to supporters, Trump's oldest son said the campaign hit the mark after sending out its first fundraising email on Tuesday.  In that appeal, Donald Trump has also said he would match the $2 million raised.  The campaign s fundraising efforts began after financial reports revealed Trump significantly trailed Hillary Clinton in funds as they both head into the general election.  Trump started the month of June with $1. 3 million in cash compared to Clinton s $42. 5 million. In Wednesday s email, Trump Jr.  continued the fundraising push, asking supporters to help his father defeat Clinton.   We all know what a disaster Crooked Hillary would be for this country if she were elected, he wrote in the email.  And the only way to stop her is to stand together and fight against her fraud and lies.   The email comes on the same day of the presumptive Republican nominee s speech, where he attacked Clinton for being a  world-class liar.

Elizabeth Warren has been an outspoken surrogate for Hillary Clinton. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) will join Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail Monday in Cincinnati, the presumptive Democratic nominee's campaign announced Wednesday. At a public event in Cincinnati, Clinton and Warren will discuss their shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, the campaign said in its announcement. Warren has been an outspoken surrogate for Clinton, and is reported to be on the former secretary of state's shortlist for vice presidential candidates.  The liberal Massachusetts senator visited Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn last Friday, where she told staff, Don't screw this up.

Democratic and Republican views of the opposing political party have sunk to such lows that many say their rivals make them feel afraid, according to an opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center.   The partisan divide among Democrats and Republicans has intensified to its highest level in nearly 25 years, according to a Pew Research Center study released Wednesday. For the first time since 1992, majorities of Democrats and Republicans have  very unfavorable  views of the opposing party.  While just 37 percent of Democrats and 32 percent of Republicans had very unfavorable views of the opposing party in 2008, the animosity has grown so much that 55 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans now say they have very unfavorable views of the other party. But the negative feelings don t stop there.  A majority of Democrats say they are fearful of (55 percent) and frustrated by (58 percent) the GOP, and 47 percent say they are angered by the Republican Party. The feelings, however, are largely mutual.  Nearly 50 percent of Republicans say they are afraid of the Democratic Party, with 57 percent saying they are frustrated and 46 percent expressing anger. The frustration among Democrats and Republicans surveyed is consistent with the levels of frustration among partisans who say they re highly politically engaged   meaning they always or nearly always vote and have volunteered for or contributed to a campaign in the past year.  But highly engaged partisans are more afraid of (Democrats, 70 percent; Republicans, 62 percent) and angry at (Democrats, 58 percent; Republicans, 58 percent) the other party. In terms of policy, partisanship prevails over bipartisanship.  Forty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans said they  almost never  agree with their party policy stances, while 2 in 10 Democrats and just 16 of Republicans  almost always  agree with their party positions. In fact, partisans say they increasingly perceive that the opposing party s policies are a threat to the nation.  In 2014, for example, among those who expressed very unfavorable views of the other party, 31 percent of Democrats and 37 percent of Republicans said the opposing party s  policies are so misguided that they threaten the nation s well-being.   Forty-one percent of Democrats and 45 percent of Republicans with very unfavorable views of the other party see that party s polices as a threat to America. Nearly 7 in 10 Democrats cite the party s policies being good for America as the  major reason  they identify with the Democratic Party, while 62 percent say a major reason they re Democrats is because GOP policies are bad.  Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans, however, attribute their negative views of Democratic policies as the major reason they identify as Republicans.  Sixty-four percent cited the Republican Party s policies as their major reason for being a Republican. Both parties do agree on at least one thing, though: that members of the other party are closed-minded.  An overwhelming 7 in 10 Democrats say Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans, while 52 percent of Republicans feel the same way regarding Democrats.  A high number of Democrats also say Republicans are more dishonest (42 percent), immoral (35 percent) and unintelligent (33 percent), while Republicans counter that Democrats are more immoral (47 percent), lazy (46 percent), dishonest (45 percent) and unintelligent (32 percent) than other Americans. Independents also lean away from a party more than they lean toward it.  A majority of Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning independents lean toward one of the major parties because they believe the other party s policies are bad for the country.  In contrast, just about 30 percent (30 percent, Republican leaners; 34 percent, Democratic leaners) lean toward a party because its policies are good for the country. Fifty-one percent of respondents say they find conversations about politics with people they disagree with  interesting and informative,  though 46 percent find it  stressful and frustrating.   But the discourse usually makes things worse.  More than 6 in 10 respondents say they tend to find out they have less in common politically than they thought, while 36 percent say they usually find out they have more in common politically than they thought. The study of partisanship and political animosity surveyed 4,385 adults online and via mail from March 2-28 and April 5-May 2 (before Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump became their parties  presumptive presidential nominees) on Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel.  The margin of error for those results is plus or minus 2. 3 percentage points.  Other results from Pew's report came from telephone interviews conducted April 12-19, surveying a national sample of 2,008 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2. 5 percentage points.

Americans feel that the economy and government have failed them, Clinton told the Post, ahead of an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she is expected contrast her economic vision with Trump's. They just are looking for somebody who will explain, in a way they will accept, what s happened, Clinton said.  So Trump comes along and he blames immigrants and he blames minorities and he blames women, and people are responsive to that because these are hard times that folks are going through.  Clinton remarked upon anxieties of the white working class in the interview, particularly those of men, saying, I think it's real.  You don t have to go just to coal country to see that,  Clinton said.   You can go to a lot of parts of America, where people had good, decent jobs that provided a good middle-class life for them and their kids.  That was the American Dream.

Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a campaign rally December 2, 2015, in Manassas, Virginia.  Hillary Clinton s tenure as secretary of state produced a more turbulent, dangerous Middle East and birthed the Islamic State terrorist group responsible for violent attacks around the world, Donald Trump said Wednesday. Trump attacked Clinton on one of her strongest resume points, her tenure as America s chief diplomat, in a much-anticipated speech outlining her deficiencies as a candidate for president.  No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton, he said during the address, held at his Trump SoHo hotel. Trump contrasted the world before Clinton took over in Foggy Bottom with the one she left behind after stepping down in 2013.  Libya and Syria were stable and Iraq was growing safer, Trump said, before Clinton took the reins.  Under her watch, Trump said, all three became a haven for extremists as a result of mismanaged American foreign policy.  Clinton, Trump said, opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam. He accused Clinton of sleeping soundly during the terrorist attack against the U. S.  consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, and of lying to cover up the truth about his death.  As secretary of state, the presumptive GOP nominee said, Clinton  managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.   But Clinton s record of destructive foreign policy began much earlier, he said   when she was a senator representing New York.  Trump noted that she supported George W.  Bush s 2003 decision to invade Iraq and depose dictator Saddam Hussein   a position she has since disavowed.  He reiterated his claim that he ha opposed the war in Iraq from its very onset, an assertion that has been repeatedly been proven untrue.  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama,  Trump said.   In short, Hillary Clinton s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.

Anyone who was alive on this planet knows about the attacks in Orlando and probably knows there s a heightened concern,  Sen.  John McCain (R-Ariz. ), one of the amendment s sponsors, said Tuesday.    The Senate failed to advance a GOP proposal Wednesday that would broaden the FBI s ability to obtain internet records from technology companies, dealing a blow to Republicans who want to expand the government's intelligence capabilities after the Orlando, Fla. , nightclub shooting this month. The measure, an amendment to the Justice Department spending bill, was defeated by a vote of 58-38, falling two votes short of the 60-vote threshold needed to move forward.  GOP lawmakers had been banking on a shift in congressional sentiment since last year, when Congress voted to curb the NSA s surveillance powers as part of reforms driven by revelations from Edward Snowden. The amendment would have allowed the FBI to use National Security Letters   which don t require judicial approval   to obtain internet records like email metadata and browsing history as part of terrorism investigations.

McCain added that FBI Director James Comey says the legislative fix, had it been on the books at the time, would have helped law enforcement thwart the self-styled jihadi who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando   a suggestion the amendment s detractors disputed. Never once has the FBI suggested this would have prevented Orlando, Sen.  Ron Wyden (D-Ore. ) said on the Senate floor before the vote. The measure would have also made permanent the PATRIOT Act s  lone wolf  provision, which intelligence officials use to monitor terrorism suspects who aren t connected to overseas organizations. The FBI has long pushed for the change, which it says is akin to fixing a typo in surveillance law.  But civil liberties groups and tech companies oppose the amendment, arguing that it would give government officials new power to obtain revealing information about a person with no court oversight.  They also say the government can easily get the same kind of information with an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and do so rapidly in emergencies. Republican supporters of the measure said repeatedly that it wouldn t allow counterterrorism officials to force tech companies to hand over the content of a suspect s communications.  It will allow the FBI to collect the dots so they can connect the dots, and that's been the biggest problem they've had in identifying these home-grown radicalized terrorists like the shooter in Orlando,  Sen.  John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters Tuesday.  Republicans started to push the surveillance update even before Orlando.  A similar provision is included in the chamber s yet-to-be-approved 2017 Intelligence Authorization bill, and Cornyn sought to add it to an email privacy bill that is stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a world-class liar who may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her pathetic email and server statements, Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me, Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's rigged against the American people. In contrast, Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft, Trump said. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash, Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001, Trump said.  They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. Clinton does not have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office, Trump said. Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people, Trump sid to applause.  She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Trump used details from Clinton Cash, the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  (The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as false, right-wing attacks funded by the Koch brothers. )Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server, Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger, Trump continued.  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. He continued, National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, Trump said.  She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. Trump also alleged that Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State  threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, [yeah, I guess so and I wish the first time it was done correctly when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya, Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it, he said.   This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  Vowing to build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth and ensure the military will have the best technology and finest equipment, Trump promised massive new factories that will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know, he said.  I say, nobody knows it better.  Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a world-class liar who may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her pathetic email and server statements, Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me, Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's rigged against the American people. In contrast, Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft, Trump said. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash, Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001, Trump said.  They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. Clinton does not have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office, Trump said. Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people, Trump sid to applause.  She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Trump used details from Clinton Cash, the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  (The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as false, right-wing attacks funded by the Koch brothers. )Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server, Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger, Trump continued.  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. He continued, National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, Trump said.  She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. Trump also alleged that Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State  threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama.

Donna Edwards' officeMore than two dozen House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor Wednesday in protest of GOP leadership's refusal to allow a vote on a gun control measure following the Orlando massacre. Led by Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. ), the civil rights icon, and more than 40 Democrats walked into the chamber just before noon and pledged to  occupy  the House floor until GOP leadership allowed a vote.  Democrats have tried numerous times over the past week to force a vote on a so-called no fly, no buy bill, which would bar terror suspects on the  no-fly list from purchasing guns.  We have been too quiet for too long,  Lewis said.   There comes a time when you have to say something.  You have to make a little noise.  You have to move your feet.  This is the time.  How many more mothers? How many more fathers need to shed tears of grief before we do something? Lewis continued, his voice rising in intensity.  Give us a vote.  Let us vote.  We came here to do our job.  We came here to work.  The protest seemed to catch Republicans off guard.  As another House Democrat prepared to speak, the GOP lawmaker presiding over the chamber suddenly declared the House was in recess and shut off microphones. Democrats including Reps.  Joe Crowley (N. Y. ), Donna Edwards (Md. ) and John Larson (Conn. ) then sat down on the floor by the front podium.  They began reading the names of those who died in the June 12 shooting at a Florida nightclub that left 49 dead and 53 wounded.  No bill, no break,  Democrats chanted, repeating recent demands that House GOP leaders cancel the upcoming House recess until they vote on gun control. Clyburn led a prayer, as members clasped hands in a circle.  How greatly we ache for those lives lost, those families destroyed, those communities that have been broken because of our refusal to speak up, stand up and support just laws that will ensure safety and security, Lewis said. We've had it.  We're not going to watch any more people in this country get slaughtered and do nothing! Rep.  Mike Doyle (D-Pa. ) yelled during the protest.  Break the shackles! Rep.  Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said at another point. Republicans showed no signs of bowing to Democrats' demand.  The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ), said in a statement.

John Shinkle Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton got a raucous welcome from House Democrats on Wednesday during her first visit to Capitol Hill since clinching the nomination. Entering the meeting to chants of Hillary, Hillary! The theme of the day was one word - unity, unity, and more unity.  We need to unify the country, Clinton said to applause. Invited to address rank-and-file lawmakers by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (Calif. ), Clinton told Democrats that she will compete in all 50 states and coordinate as much as possible with Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents. But Clinton also noted that battleground states will get her most attention, as would be expected.  I mean, I've been to Ohio three times, Clinton said, according to a Democratic lawmaker. Clinton also spoke about how she unified Democrats in 2008 following her long, bitter primary battle with now President Barack Obama, even though some of her supporters urged her to continue opposing Obama.  Clinton noted she stopped the roll call vote during the convention that year, demonstrating her support for Obama. While Democrats have nowhere near the turmoil that Republicans face over Donald Trump, Clinton and Democratic leaders must work to win over the progressive wing of the party, which had strongly supported Sen.  Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt. ) bid for the nomination.  While Sanders had only a fraction of Clinton's support among House Democrats, party officials are keenly aware that they need Bernie voters to win in November. Clinton also told Democrats   and it was music to their ears   that she wants to win back control of the House and Senate. It's about House Democrats taking back the House, [Democrats taking back the Senate, said Rep.  Gregory Meeks (D-N. Y. ).  It's not just about her, it's about all of us. The fact that she recognized that down ballot races were in play was great.  That recognition was very well received, added Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ). Not giving up on potential gains in the South, which is overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, pleased some Democrats, although the reality is that any such effort is unlikely to yield much barring a total Trump collapse. In other words, don't write off the South, said Rep.  Elijah Cummings (D-Md. )There were some light moments in the meeting as well.  When Becerra   who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick   offered Clinton some water, Rep.  Joe Crowley joked, Man, you're really working it.  The Democrats erupted in laughter.  And Pelosi gave Clinton a gift for her new grandson. While Clinton mentioned Trump during her appearance, there was little focus on the presumptive Republican nominee. Instead, Democrats played up their cohesion coming out of the Wednesday's session, as compared to what's happening with their GOP counterparts. What we saw in that room just now was a person who is extraordinarily competent, extraordinary able, said Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md. )People who are representatives in the democratic caucus, we really like our candidate.  We really like our candidate, Crowley said.  The New York Democrat said he would love to be a fly on the wall when House Republicans meet with Trump on July 7. Republicans responded to the Clinton visit by issuing statements bashing the Democratic standard-bearer, and GOP leadership aides noted privately that the Benghazi committee   chaired by Rep.  Trey Gowdy (R-S. C. )   is still drafting its report on the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead, including the U. S.  ambassador to Libya.

Remarks as prepared for delivery.  Today I d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election. People have asked me why I am running for President. I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day. We come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big, and then we make it happen. I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me. The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.  But we can t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them. We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That s why we re asking Bernie Sanders  voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.  Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it s not just the political system that s rigged.  It s the whole economy. It s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U. S.  with absolutely no consequences for them. It s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It s rigged against you, the American people. Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie. Brian Williams  career was destroyed for saying far less. Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.  But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.  I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.  That is a talent our country desperately needs. I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first. We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians. Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D. C. The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests   and taking money from special interests. Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash. Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never change. The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control. Those are the stakes. Hillary Clinton wants to be President.  But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president. She believes she is entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is  I m with her.  You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people. She thinks it s all about her. I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism   focusing on what s good for America s middle class   to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy. We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs. We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again. That s what we mean by America First. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores. Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for  the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing  in America. Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China s entrance into the World Trade Organization. We ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned. Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property   a crime which is continuing to this day. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America s expense. She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book:  At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States. She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas   and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.  She has even deleted this record of total support from her book   deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing. )But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.  She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career   and it will be even worse than the Clintons  NAFTA deal. I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers. We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president. It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars   and unleashed ISIS across the world. No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.  He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security. Hillary Clinton s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death. Here is what one of the victim s mothers had to say: I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don t want this person to be president.  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel. ISIS wasn t even on the map. Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen   while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.  The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora s box of radical Islam. Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality   and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short, Hillary Clinton s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticizethe rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power,she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office: She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to servein the office from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true Her leadership style   volcanic, impulsive disdainful of the rules set for everyone else   hasn t changed a bit.  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number. Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth   with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U. S. The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of themost repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth. I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslavedand gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Here is some more of what we learned from the book,Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.  So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.  The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions. Hillary Clinton s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access   even though he had no national security credentials. Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State   plus millions more for her foundation.  The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.  The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death. Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens. To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China   putting all of America in danger. Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do. So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States. This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency. We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. National security is also immigration security  and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United StatesThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.  They are the ones she will hurt the most. Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton. Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here is an excerpt from Mrs.  Mendoza s letter: Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms  way   an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country.  Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.  She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.  Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration. For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. Hillary s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.  She can t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workersto compete against them. Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days: Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.  Hillary Clinton s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment. Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster. Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs. Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State. There is one common theme in all of these reforms. It s going to be America First. This is why the stakes in November are so great. On election day, the politicians stand trial before the people. The voters are the jury.  Their ballots are the verdict.  We don t need or want another Clinton or Obama. Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold outtheir country. They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change. My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it.  This is our last chance to do it. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more. Then we started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose, and daring. But that s not who we are. Come this November, we can bring America back   bigger and better, and stronger than ever. We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth   the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow. Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment   we will bring it back all the way. Massive new factories will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities. Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better. The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.  Hillary s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone. We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do. I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices. Our country is going to start working again. People are going to start working again. Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again   including parents in our inner cities. Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country. We are going to make America rich again. We are going to make America safe again. We are going to make America Great Again   and Great Again For EVERYONE.  Remarks as prepared for delivery.  Today I d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election. People have asked me why I am running for President. I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day. We come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big, and then we make it happen. I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me. The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.  But we can t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them. We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That s why we re asking Bernie Sanders  voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.  Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it s not just the political system that s rigged.  It s the whole economy. It s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U. S.  with absolutely no consequences for them. It s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It s rigged against you, the American people. Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie. Brian Williams  career was destroyed for saying far less. Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.  But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.  I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.  That is a talent our country desperately needs. I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first. We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians. Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D. C. The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests   and taking money from special interests. Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash. Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never change. The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control. Those are the stakes. Hillary Clinton wants to be President.  But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president. She believes she is entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is  I m with her.  You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people. She thinks it s all about her. I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism   focusing on what s good for America s middle class   to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy. We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs. We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again. That s what we mean by America First. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores. Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for  the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing  in America. Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China s entrance into the World Trade Organization. We ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned. Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property   a crime which is continuing to this day. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America s expense. She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book:  At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States. She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas   and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.  She has even deleted this record of total support from her book   deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing. )But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.  She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career   and it will be even worse than the Clintons  NAFTA deal. I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers. We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president. It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars   and unleashed ISIS across the world. No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.  He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security. Hillary Clinton s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death. Here is what one of the victim s mothers had to say: I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don t want this person to be president.  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel. ISIS wasn t even on the map. Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen   while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.  The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora s box of radical Islam. Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality   and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short, Hillary Clinton s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticizethe rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power,she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office: She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to servein the office from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true Her leadership style   volcanic, impulsive disdainful of the rules set for everyone else   hasn t changed a bit.  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number. Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth   with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U. S. The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of themost repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth. I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslavedand gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Here is some more of what we learned from the book,Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.  So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.  The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions. Hillary Clinton s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access   even though he had no national security credentials. Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State   plus millions more for her foundation.  The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.  The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death. Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens. To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.

Donald Trump speaks to a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally on June 18, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona.    When Donald Trump told a private gathering of evangelical leaders on Tuesday that  we don t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion, the presumptive Republican nominee says he did not mean it in a bad way. I said I know nothing about it, I know nothing   I m not saying that in a negative way, Trump told CBS' Norah O'Donnell in an interview aired on CBS This Morning.  But, you know, I ve watched Hillary for a long time.  I just don t know anything about her faith.  I wouldn t question her faith, but somebody said to me, what do you think? And I said don t know anything about it. Clinton has spoken about her Methodist faith on many occasions, including on the campaign trail.  During a CNN town hall in February, a rabbi asked her how she balanced the ego of running for president with the humility the crushing responsibilities of the job impose. I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self-conscious as possible.  This is hard for me, she said, revealing that she receives a scripture lesson each morning by 5 a. m.  from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with. Trump suggested, however, that he has not been fully briefed on Clinton's faith. I don t think I did anything wrong, he told O'Donnell.  Now we can make that into a headline because that s what the press usually does, but the fact is I just don t know anything about her faith. During a separate interview with ABC's David Muir on Good Morning America, Trump was asked what he would like to know about Clinton's faith that is not already known. Nothing   whatever it is, I just don't know.  Somebody asked me the question, Trump said.  Muir then asked why Trump would bring it up, to which he responded, I didn't bring it up.  I said, I don't know much about her religion.                  Donald Trump speaks to a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally on June 18, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona.

A federal judge struck down the Bureau of Land Management s March 2015 fracking rule, saying the Interior Department does not have the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing.   /Brennan LinsleyA federal judge today struck down the Bureau of Land Management s March 2015 fracking rule, saying the Interior Department does not have the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing.  Congress has not delegated to the Department of Interior the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing,  concluded Judge Scott W.  Skavdahl of the U. S.  District Court of Wyoming.   The BLM's effort to do so through the Fracking Rule is in excess of its statutory authority and contrary to law.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005  expressly removed  Interior's authority to regulate most types of fracking, the judge concluded.  (The law does allow BLM to regulate fracking involving diesel fuel. ) The Safe Drinking Water Act gives EPA the authority and duty to regulate hydraulic fracturing on all lands, federal, state and tribal,  he wrote. Interior argued that neither the SDWA nor the 2005 EPAct specifically prohibited regulating fracking under other laws   but Skavdahl wasn't buying it.  Congress' inability or unwillingness to pass a law desired by the executive branch does not default authority to the executive branch to act independently, regardless of whether hydraulic fracturing is good or bad for the environment or the citizens of the United States,  Skavdahl wrote. Skavdahl, who was named to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, put a temporary injunction on the rule last summer.  An appeal of that injunction is pending in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, though it was unclear whether that appeal would move forward given Skavdahl s ruling.

Mayor Jim Kenney plans to defend his tax plan in court.    Philadelphia made waves nationally last week when its city council voted, 13-4, to make it the first major U. S.  city to impose a hefty sin tax on soft drinks.  The 1. 5 percent per ounce tax on both sugary and diet drinks to fund children's education and park programs in the city was a controversial move that health advocates hope will take hold in other cities and states.  The architect of the effort   Mayor Jim Kenney   stopped into POLITICO s offices Tuesday for a wide-ranging conversation with Pro Ag Senior Reporter Helena Bottemiller Evich on how he beat Big Soda, how he plans to defend his tax plan in court and what advice he d give to other mayors looking to follow in his footsteps.  [Their miscalculation is that they thought the people were stupid . . . BOTTEMILLER EVICH: No less than 43 locales have tried to pass soda taxes   Philly tried twice   I always used to say the American Beverage Association was batting a thousand.  Why do you think Philly broke through? What was different this time? KENNEY: This time the revenue was tied specifically to initiatives that people want to see happen.  I honestly believe that there's an element of nanny-state pushback when people are told what they should and shouldn't drink or smoke or eat.  And we knew from past experiences that the health issue   although it's real and it's an ancillary benefit, an important one   that if we constructed the effort just on that we would have failed again.  The pre-K commission did its work.  It was clearly a strong identification with pre-K needs.  Everyone wants their parks recreation centers, their libraries to look the best they can look in the community school model.  Although it's a smaller part of the whole effort, it was also a very positive thing.  We put together a coalition of people, clergy, labor, pre-K mommies and dads, park advocates library advocates.  Some health folks joined obviously   with [Michael Bloomberg the major concern of his was health   and we went with an army of unpaid people who wanted to advocate for specific programs up against an army of highly paid people who were conducting a campaign of misinformation.  It never was a grocery tax.  From my perspective and my opinion, their miscalculation is that they thought the people were stupid and that they would totally eat the idea of a grocery tax.  In the end, diet [beverages became part of it because it was part of the negotiation to get us the nine votes or the 13 votes we needed.  It was always about sugar-sweetened beverages.  It was never about anything else.  I think people recognize that this was a way to generate significant revenue without raising their real estate taxes, without raising their wage taxes, without raising business taxes, because those are all the taxes that we've always [used to fund education.  People accepted it and they made their voices clear to their council members.  Staff did an awesome job of keeping everything and everybody together everything together in dealing with specific negotiations from council member council member.  I think the other advantage we had is that there are 17 members of council, it doesn't have to go to a referendum.  But I think if it had gone to a referendum, it still would have won, but it's easier to convince nine people than win a referendum.  A $7 million offer from the soda industry BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Did you feel like you knew your opponent because Philly had floated this twice before, or were there any tactics that surprised you? At one point I saw that [the American Beverage Association offered to pay for a year of universal pre-K.  KENNEY: Yeah, but they came down $3 million under what was offered five years ago; $10 million was the offer a while ago.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Did they come directly to you with an offer? KENNEY: Well they were whining that we wouldn t meet with them.  I really didn't want to be with them because there was nothing really to talk about.  Then these folks [pointing to staff said you should meet with them and then they can't say you didn't meet with them.  So we met with them.  That's when the offer came.  But by the time I was sitting at the table I'm pretty sure we had nine or 10 votes, so I was like thanks for the offer, appreciate it, but we're not interested.  It was a short meeting. Philadelphia's efforts to pass a soda tax, in 2010 and 2011, weren't properly framedBOTTEMILLER EVICH: Where did the idea of a soda tax come from? My understanding is that you were opposed to this idea when the city council had initially floated it [in 2010 and 2011.  KENNEY: There were no identifiable projects.  First of all, it was a health initiative and then Mayor [Michael Nutter backed off the health initiative and went for a budget hole filler for schools.  It wasn't framed at all.  It was just like we should do it because it's the right thing to do.  I honestly believe that people, and this is just my own personal view, council members at the time felt that Mayor Nutter was so interested in this more for a national profile than actually the issue itself.  I remember people saying to me, You know he just wants to go travel, read and give speeches about this.  I mean it's all water under the bridge, because it didn't work.  But this was very gratifying because I never expected 13 votes.  All four of the Republicans very clearly told me they were a no.  And they didn't play around.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So there was never a point where you thought you weren't going to get it through in the last month? KENNEY: Maybe in the last month.  Anything could happen and when they pulled out that this is is going to the fund balance, that whole argument was somewhat of a concern because it was getting some traction in local press, but you know, we clearly explained what it was, that it takes time for programs to ramp up.  In the meantime, you're collecting the tax and money sits in the general fund until it really ramped up and then you take the money and pay for it so it's not.  They were trying to make it a bait and switch.  They were trying everything at the end.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Was there anything about your opponents' tactics that surprised you? KENNEY: The amount of money that they spent.  I think that they seemed to be a bit unfocused in articulating why [they were opposed.  It was just, it's bad, it's a grocery tax, it's regressive, it's going to fall on poor people   which I thought was kind of laughable because they made their billions of profits off of poor people for generations and we were asking for a little bit of the money to stay in neighborhoods so we could fix up rec centers and libraries and send kids to pre-K and they would rather maintain their profits than give the kids a chance at a pre-K education and a successful life. We would not have gone through all the effort we went through if we didn't think it was going to stand up in court. BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Are other mayors calling you now, asking you how you did this and trying to replicate? KENNEY: I haven't talked to any other mayors.  We got an invitation for September to go out to Berkeley to talk to them about a conference on this whole issue.  But we just got done today.  I have not heard from any other mayors specifically, but that doesn't mean staff haven't reached out to staff.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Or maybe they want to see if you win your lawsuit first.  KENNEY: I mean, that's the next thing, but I know this is a very defensible case.  We would not have gone through all the effort we went through if we didn't think it was going to stand up in court.  We knew they were going to sue us if we were successful and we'll fight that battle, too.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: You feel you have the resources to defend it? KENNEY: Oh yeah, sure.  We have a lot less resources than they do, but we have resources to defend it. BOTTEMILLER EVICH: How and where were you when you decided that a soda tax is going to be your platform? Was it right out the gate, because you really put everything you had into this? KENNEY: We started talking about how we fund pre-K, community schools and the parks, recs and libraries renovations and to Rob Dubow, who's our finance director, I said, Well, how am I going to pay for all this, and he went Soda taxes. I said, Oh, I don't know if we're going to be able to get that done.  And he said, No, we can do it, we can get it done.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So your mathman told you to do it.  KENNEY: Yeah my mathman said it would work.  I was skeptical at the beginning.  I don't want to beat anybody.  What I want to do is beat poverty. BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Do you drink soda? KENNEY: Yeah I do, I drink diet Pepsi.  I like it.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: Bloomberg has said he wants to help other cities replicate what you all were able to achieve, which was to beat Big Soda, a very formidable adversary.  KENNEY: I don t want to beat anybody.  What I want to do is beat poverty.  I didn t pump my fist in the air and jump up and down and say, We won! I don t act that way.  BOTTEMILLER EVICH: The health advocates did that for you, then. KENNEY: Yes they did.  And the pre-K mommies did that, too. BOTTEMILLER EVICH: So when the other cities, states, call you, what are you going to tell local officials about going down this road?KENNEY: Tie it to initiatives that the public wants.  Build a coalition around those initiatives.  And just continue to grow the coalition and don t worry about the big money.  It s clear now that the big money isn t all it s cracked up to be.                  Mayor Jim Kenney plans to defend his tax plan in court.    Philadelphia made waves nationally last week when its city council voted, 13-4, to make it the first major U. S.  city to impose a hefty sin tax on soft drinks.  The 1. 5 percent per ounce tax on both sugary and diet drinks to fund children's education and park programs in the city was a controversial move that health advocates hope will take hold in other cities and states.  The architect of the effort   Mayor Jim Kenney   stopped into POLITICO s offices Tuesday for a wide-ranging conversation with Pro Ag Senior Reporter Helena Bottemiller Evich on how he beat Big Soda, how he plans to defend his tax plan in court and what advice he d give to other mayors looking to follow in his footsteps.  [Their miscalculation is that they thought the people were stupid . . . BOTTEMILLER EVICH: No less than 43 locales have tried to pass soda taxes   Philly tried twice   I always used to say the American Beverage Association was batting a thousand.  Why do you think Philly broke through? What was different this time? KENNEY: This time the revenue was tied specifically to initiatives that people want to see happen.  I honestly believe that there's an element of nanny-state pushback when people are told what they should and shouldn't drink or smoke or eat.  And we knew from past experiences that the health issue   although it's real and it's an ancillary benefit, an important one   that if we constructed the effort just on that we would have failed again.  The pre-K commission did its work.  It was clearly a strong identification with pre-K needs.  Everyone wants their parks recreation centers, their libraries to look the best they can look in the community school model.  Although it's a smaller part of the whole effort, it was also a very positive thing.  We put together a coalition of people, clergy, labor, pre-K mommies and dads, park advocates library advocates.  Some health folks joined obviously   with [Michael Bloomberg the major concern of his was health   and we went with an army of unpaid people who wanted to advocate for specific programs up against an army of highly paid people who were conducting a campaign of misinformation.  It never was a grocery tax.  From my perspective and my opinion, their miscalculation is that they thought the people were stupid and that they would totally eat the idea of a grocery tax.

As Donald Trump gears up for his all-out war on Hillary and Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican nominee on Wednesday is planning to draw ammunition from the controversies that have dogged the family, and particularly its Clinton Foundation, for years.  I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Trump tweeted Tuesday, teasing out an address scheduled for Trump SoHo in New York, a day after Clinton laced into his economic and business acumen. Trump initially planned to deliver a speech, originally scheduled for June 13 in New Hampshire, discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.  But after the Orlando attack, Trump instead refocused that address on national security.  Now, he'll be back on the attack   helped by four decades' worth of statements, association, innuendo and scandal.  And the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which has been embroiled in political controversy from its inception in 1997, is going to be at the top of Trump's target list.  Before Clinton even formally announced her campaign last spring, conservative author Peter Schweizer was writing Clinton Cash, digging into the foundation's financial dealings and connections.  Less than a month into her run, questions resurfaced about a series of issues related to the foundation, from troublesome tax returns to myriad donations from countries with less than stellar human rights records.  And while the media frenzy has subsided somewhat in 2016, Trump's early line of attack suggests that as organization Bill Clinton describes as one that has done a lot of good things is about to be dragged back into a turbulent political season. In a sneak preview of the coming battle royale, Trump declared that Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund, during a speech June 7 at his Westchester County golf club.  On Tuesday, Trump's rapid-response effort kicked into high gear, firing off multiple tweets, posts and emails seeking to undercut Clinton's argument that he would be disastrous for the economy while promoting his own policies.  And he accused the former first couple of laundering money and making hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts. There's sure to be more.  Here is a pocket guide to where Trump might attack:Tuesday's warningAs Clinton finished up her speech laying into Trump's economic policies, the Republican's burgeoning rapid-response unit sent forth an avalanche of emails, tweets and social media posts critiquing both the candidate and former president for a series of misdeeds, ranging from instances of alleged personal impropriety to broad responsibility for the state of the American economy. In the first of nine emails sent out directly before, during and minutes after the former secretary of state spoke to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, Trump's campaign pointed out that Mark Zandi, an economist who Clinton pointed out in her address advised McCain, had donated to the Democratic candidate and had his policies praised by the current administration. Another email sought to link Tuesday's news that Boeing had reached an agreement with Iran's largest airline as a consequence of the Iranian nuclear deal, stating, Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terror, would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. Trump's campaign later attacked Clinton's lack of poise under pressure in response to her argument that he lacks the proper temperament to be president, referring to a forthcoming book by a former Secret Service agent who wrote that what he saw in the 1990s sickened me. A later email alleged that as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to her husband through organization Laureate Education while he was still an honorary chairman for the educational for-profit organization. The White House ethics agreementFoundation officials disclosed in February 2015 that one donation made during Clinton s time at Foggy Bottom violated the ethics agreement the foundation had signed with the Obama administration. The agreement was reached in 2008, before Clinton was nominated as secretary of state, as the incoming White House expressed concern about countries using the foundation to leverage political favor from the State Department.  The memo did not ban donations from foreign countries with a stake in U. S.  interests, with one exception.  The agreement blocked donations to the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosts the fancy annual Clinton Foundation event starring the former president and other world leaders.  In the one instance acknowledged as a violation more than a year ago, foundation officials said they should have submitted a $500,000 donation in 2010 from the Algerian government for its Haiti earthquake relief fund to the State Department for approval.  This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed.  This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since,  a spokesman told POLITICO at the time. Should Hillary Clinton be elected president, [there'll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it, Bill Clinton told Bloomberg TV on June 14, echoing what the campaign has said. The donations that  slipped through the cracks The day after Trump promised to unleash on the foundation, Clinton and her surrogates began a two-day media blitz.  During the first day of that press tour, they answered multiple questions about disclosure surrounding their donors, remarking that the organization went above and beyond requirements in an effort to be transparent. We had absolutely overwhelming disclosure,  she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.   Were there, you know, one or two instances that slipped through the cracks? Yes.  But was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed? Absolutely.  The time a donor got on a sensitive intelligence boardRajiv K.  Fernando, a Democratic donor and Chicago securities trader who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board in 2011 despite lacking the qualifications of his colleagues.   We had no idea who he was,  one board member said, according to a June 10 ABC News report.  ABC's report detailed emails its journalists obtained from Citizens United through the Freedom of Information Act.  The emails further reveal how, after inquiries from ABC News, the Clinton staff sought to  protect the name  of the Secretary,  stall  the ABC News reporter and ultimately accept the resignation of the donor just two days later,  ABC reported. The emails provided to ABC, according to the report, showed a State Department official unable to immediately answer why Fernando was on the panel.  The true answer is simply that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him,  Wade Boese, who was Chief of Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, wrote in an email to press aide Jamie Mannina, according to ABC s report.   Raj was not on the list sent to S [secretary of state; he was added at their insistence.  Emails released by the State Department as part of the court-ordered schedule do not explicitly show Clinton being involved in Fernando s placement.  In one email from 2010 provided to ABC with the subject line  ISAB,  shorthand for the organization, chief of staff Cheryl Mills wrote,  The secretary had two other names she wanted looked at.   The case of the errant tax returnsAs part of the renewed scrutiny on the Clinton Foundation in the spring of 2015, Reuters reported in April that a review showed errors in how it reported donations from foreign governments on its forms 990 from 2010 through 2012. The Clinton Foundation in November filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes, Clinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said in a statement at the time.  Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review.  The speaking fees, part IAlso on the heels of Schweizer s book came a report from ABC News in April 2015 that Bill Clinton s speaking fees had begun to double or triple after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. The report noted that the former president, who usually pulled down $150,000 per speech after leaving the White House, was paid $500,000 by a Russian investment bank and $750,000 to address a telecom conference in China. At a time when Bernie Sanders was pushing Clinton on her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, a CNN analysis in February found that the Clintons earned more than $153 million combined in 729 separate paid speeches from February 2001 until May 2015. The speaking fees, part IIThe same week other outlets were reporting on Schweizer s findings, The Washington Post s Rosalind Helderman reported that Bill Clinton took in at least $26 million to speak to organizations that have also donated to the foundation.  It s not surprising that organizations who believe strongly in the Clinton Foundation s mission and are impressed by its results are genuinely interested in President Clinton s perspective,  Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post at the time.   The president often says the foundation is his life today, and he welcomes any opportunity to educate people about it and encourage more people to work together to solve some of the most critical global challenges we all face.  In its analysis, the Post reported that among the approximately 420 organizations that paid Clinton to speak between 2001 and 2013, 67 of them also donated at least $10,000 each to the charity. The Russian uranium dealAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton sat on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which had before it a request to approve the sale of U. S.  uranium stock to Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom as part of a transitioned takeover of a company which through an earlier merger had acquired U. S.  uranium interests. Following on Schweizer s research, The New York Times reported in April 2015 that Canadian businessman Frank Giustra had acquired uranium interests during a 2005 trip to Kazakhstan with Bill Clinton.  Giustra, whose up and coming UrAsia merged with the South African company Uranium One in 2007, gave more than $31 million to the foundation in 2006 and pledged $100 million more. Rosatom took over 17 percent of Uranium One in 2009, increasing to 51 percent in 2010 and the rest of the company in 2013.  Ian Telfer, who chaired Uranium One at the time of its acquisition by Rosatom, donated $2. 35 million in four separate gifts through his family foundation. Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown, the Times reported in the article.  But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation s donors. The UBS dealThe Wall Street Journal reported last July that Clinton intervened on behalf of Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which the Internal Revenue Service was suing to get the identities of Americans with offshore accounts. After that intervention in 2009, donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation increased from less than $60,000 to a total of $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the Journal s report.  Additionally, the bank lent $32 million to the foundation to jumpstart its entrepreneurship and inner-city loan program, and Bill Clinton received $1. 5 million to do question-and-answer sessions with UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Bob McCann. However, the Journal s report acknowledges that there is  no evidence of any link between Mrs.  Clinton s involvement in the case and the bank s donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, or its hiring of Mr.  Clinton,  while characterizing it as a  prime example of how the Clintons  private and political activities overlap.    Any suggestion that she was driven by anything but what s in America s best interest would be false.  Period,  a Clinton campaign spokesman told the Journal at the time. The foreign donationsAfter Clinton left office in 2013, the foundation lifted its ban on donations from foreign governments.  The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that recent donors to the foundation included the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, Germany and a Canadian government agency seeking the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. As recently as this month, Bernie Sanders seized upon the foreign donations in questioning in the judgment of Clinton to be commander in chief. If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are dictatorships  yeah, I do, Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview aired June 5. Asked whether the foundation's ongoing activities presented an ongoing conflict of interest, Sanders responded, Yes, I do. Trump himself has openly boasted that Sanders' lines about Clinton's paid speeches would be useful fodder in a general election bout, even as the Vermont senator has vowed to do everything in his power to keep the presumptive Republican nominee from the White House. Five days before Clinton declared victory in the Democratic primary, Trump tweeted, Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!On Tuesday, the Trump campaign said that the foundation had accepted between approximately $21. 3 million and $65. 5 million from the governments of countries with policies hostile toward women's rights, gay rights and human rights, including Algeria, Brunei, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Friends of Saudi Arabia organization and the Zayeds, the ruling family of the Emirates. Promoting his major speech, Trump told supporters on the night of the final Republican primaries, I think you re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.  I wonder if the press will want to attend.  Who knows? As Donald Trump gears up for his all-out war on Hillary and Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican nominee on Wednesday is planning to draw ammunition from the controversies that have dogged the family, and particularly its Clinton Foundation, for years.  I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Trump tweeted Tuesday, teasing out an address scheduled for Trump SoHo in New York, a day after Clinton laced into his economic and business acumen.

Another email sought to link Tuesday's news that Boeing had reached an agreement with Iran's largest airline as a consequence of the Iranian nuclear deal, stating, Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terror, would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. Trump's campaign later attacked Clinton's lack of poise under pressure in response to her argument that he lacks the proper temperament to be president, referring to a forthcoming book by a former Secret Service agent who wrote that what he saw in the 1990s sickened me. A later email alleged that as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to her husband through organization Laureate Education while he was still an honorary chairman for the educational for-profit organization. The White House ethics agreementFoundation officials disclosed in February 2015 that one donation made during Clinton s time at Foggy Bottom violated the ethics agreement the foundation had signed with the Obama administration. The agreement was reached in 2008, before Clinton was nominated as secretary of state, as the incoming White House expressed concern about countries using the foundation to leverage political favor from the State Department.  The memo did not ban donations from foreign countries with a stake in U. S.  interests, with one exception.  The agreement blocked donations to the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosts the fancy annual Clinton Foundation event starring the former president and other world leaders.  In the one instance acknowledged as a violation more than a year ago, foundation officials said they should have submitted a $500,000 donation in 2010 from the Algerian government for its Haiti earthquake relief fund to the State Department for approval.  This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed.  This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since,  a spokesman told POLITICO at the time. Should Hillary Clinton be elected president, [there'll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it, Bill Clinton told Bloomberg TV on June 14, echoing what the campaign has said. The donations that  slipped through the cracks The day after Trump promised to unleash on the foundation, Clinton and her surrogates began a two-day media blitz.  During the first day of that press tour, they answered multiple questions about disclosure surrounding their donors, remarking that the organization went above and beyond requirements in an effort to be transparent. We had absolutely overwhelming disclosure,  she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.   Were there, you know, one or two instances that slipped through the cracks? Yes.  But was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed? Absolutely.  The time a donor got on a sensitive intelligence boardRajiv K.  Fernando, a Democratic donor and Chicago securities trader who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board in 2011 despite lacking the qualifications of his colleagues.   We had no idea who he was,  one board member said, according to a June 10 ABC News report.  ABC's report detailed emails its journalists obtained from Citizens United through the Freedom of Information Act.  The emails further reveal how, after inquiries from ABC News, the Clinton staff sought to  protect the name  of the Secretary,  stall  the ABC News reporter and ultimately accept the resignation of the donor just two days later,  ABC reported. The emails provided to ABC, according to the report, showed a State Department official unable to immediately answer why Fernando was on the panel.  The true answer is simply that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him,  Wade Boese, who was Chief of Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, wrote in an email to press aide Jamie Mannina, according to ABC s report.   Raj was not on the list sent to S [secretary of state; he was added at their insistence.  Emails released by the State Department as part of the court-ordered schedule do not explicitly show Clinton being involved in Fernando s placement.  In one email from 2010 provided to ABC with the subject line  ISAB,  shorthand for the organization, chief of staff Cheryl Mills wrote,  The secretary had two other names she wanted looked at.   The case of the errant tax returnsAs part of the renewed scrutiny on the Clinton Foundation in the spring of 2015, Reuters reported in April that a review showed errors in how it reported donations from foreign governments on its forms 990 from 2010 through 2012. The Clinton Foundation in November filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes, Clinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said in a statement at the time.  Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review.  The speaking fees, part IAlso on the heels of Schweizer s book came a report from ABC News in April 2015 that Bill Clinton s speaking fees had begun to double or triple after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. The report noted that the former president, who usually pulled down $150,000 per speech after leaving the White House, was paid $500,000 by a Russian investment bank and $750,000 to address a telecom conference in China. At a time when Bernie Sanders was pushing Clinton on her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, a CNN analysis in February found that the Clintons earned more than $153 million combined in 729 separate paid speeches from February 2001 until May 2015. The speaking fees, part IIThe same week other outlets were reporting on Schweizer s findings, The Washington Post s Rosalind Helderman reported that Bill Clinton took in at least $26 million to speak to organizations that have also donated to the foundation.  It s not surprising that organizations who believe strongly in the Clinton Foundation s mission and are impressed by its results are genuinely interested in President Clinton s perspective,  Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post at the time.   The president often says the foundation is his life today, and he welcomes any opportunity to educate people about it and encourage more people to work together to solve some of the most critical global challenges we all face.  In its analysis, the Post reported that among the approximately 420 organizations that paid Clinton to speak between 2001 and 2013, 67 of them also donated at least $10,000 each to the charity. The Russian uranium dealAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton sat on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which had before it a request to approve the sale of U. S.  uranium stock to Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom as part of a transitioned takeover of a company which through an earlier merger had acquired U. S.  uranium interests. Following on Schweizer s research, The New York Times reported in April 2015 that Canadian businessman Frank Giustra had acquired uranium interests during a 2005 trip to Kazakhstan with Bill Clinton.  Giustra, whose up and coming UrAsia merged with the South African company Uranium One in 2007, gave more than $31 million to the foundation in 2006 and pledged $100 million more. Rosatom took over 17 percent of Uranium One in 2009, increasing to 51 percent in 2010 and the rest of the company in 2013.  Ian Telfer, who chaired Uranium One at the time of its acquisition by Rosatom, donated $2. 35 million in four separate gifts through his family foundation. Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown, the Times reported in the article.  But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation s donors. The UBS dealThe Wall Street Journal reported last July that Clinton intervened on behalf of Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which the Internal Revenue Service was suing to get the identities of Americans with offshore accounts. After that intervention in 2009, donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation increased from less than $60,000 to a total of $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the Journal s report.  Additionally, the bank lent $32 million to the foundation to jumpstart its entrepreneurship and inner-city loan program, and Bill Clinton received $1. 5 million to do question-and-answer sessions with UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Bob McCann. However, the Journal s report acknowledges that there is  no evidence of any link between Mrs.  Clinton s involvement in the case and the bank s donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, or its hiring of Mr.  Clinton,  while characterizing it as a  prime example of how the Clintons  private and political activities overlap.    Any suggestion that she was driven by anything but what s in America s best interest would be false.  Period,  a Clinton campaign spokesman told the Journal at the time. The foreign donationsAfter Clinton left office in 2013, the foundation lifted its ban on donations from foreign governments.  The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that recent donors to the foundation included the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, Germany and a Canadian government agency seeking the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. As recently as this month, Bernie Sanders seized upon the foreign donations in questioning in the judgment of Clinton to be commander in chief. If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are dictatorships  yeah, I do, Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview aired June 5. Asked whether the foundation's ongoing activities presented an ongoing conflict of interest, Sanders responded, Yes, I do. Trump himself has openly boasted that Sanders' lines about Clinton's paid speeches would be useful fodder in a general election bout, even as the Vermont senator has vowed to do everything in his power to keep the presumptive Republican nominee from the White House. Five days before Clinton declared victory in the Democratic primary, Trump tweeted, Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!On Tuesday, the Trump campaign said that the foundation had accepted between approximately $21. 3 million and $65. 5 million from the governments of countries with policies hostile toward women's rights, gay rights and human rights, including Algeria, Brunei, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Friends of Saudi Arabia organization and the Zayeds, the ruling family of the Emirates. Promoting his major speech, Trump told supporters on the night of the final Republican primaries, I think you re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.  I wonder if the press will want to attend.  Who knows?                 Undated photo or selfie of Omar Mateen, identified as the gunman in mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida on June 12.    A man who claimed to be the lover of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen said the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub was motivated by revenge, not terrorism. In an interview with Univision, the man said Mateen was  100 percent gay  and that the two had carried on a  friends with benefits  relationship after meeting last year through a gay dating app.  He said he had reported his relationship with Mateen to the FBI and had been interviewed multiple times.  The FBI also confirmed to Univision that it has met with him. The man, who wore a disguise in his interview with Univision and was identified only as  Miguel,  said Mateen s attack at Orlando s Pulse nightclub was the result of a sexual encounter with two Latino men, one of which Mateen later discovered was HIV positive.  The attack, carried out at the nightclub s Latino night, was Mateen s attempt at taking revenge against a specific community of gay men who he felt had used and rejected him, the man said.  He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin, but he felt rejected.  He felt used by them.  There were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad.  Guys used him.  That really affected him,  Miguel told Univision.  I believe this crazy horrible thing he did, that was revenge. Miguel described Mateen as a  very sweet guy  who  loved to be cuddled  and frequented gay bars.  He said he was stunned when he discovered Mateen had been the shooter at Pulse, that it was  impossible that the man I know could do that.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said investigators are still looking into Mateen's contacts from the months leading up to the attack.  We stand with you to say that the good in this world far outweighs the evil, that our common humanity transcends our differences, and that our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, it s unity, and it s love,  Lynch told reporters, specifically addressing the LGBT community, on Tuesday.   We stand with you today as we grieve together, and long after the cameras are gone, we will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment, in solidarity, and in equality.

Sandford is accused of trying to take a police officer's gun and kill Trump during the weekend rally.   When a British man allegedly tried to snatch the weapon of a Las Vegas police officer at the site of one of Donald Trump's rallies last Saturday with the intent to kill him, the presumptive Republican nominee says he was unaware of the incident until he saw media reports. He said in court he wanted to kill you, Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo said during a telephone interview with Trump on Wednesday morning, referring to a Secret Service agent's report filed in Nevada court on Monday.  When did you first learn about this?Trump responded, Actually, I learned about it watching television.  They didn t tell me about it, and probably they re better off not telling me about it. But I learned about it watching television, and I can tell you this: we have tremendous Secret Service and we have tremendous police throughout this country, and I think they did a fantastic job, he continued.  The policeman whose gun was tried to be, you know, stolen by this maniac, was really fantastic.  And so police have done a great job, and Secret Service, these people are great.  They don t get the kind of credit they deserve.  I deal with them all the time.  I see them, I watch them, I know them and they re terrific, terrific people. The Secret Service did not immediately return a request for comment. Asked specifically about reports that the man had overstayed his visa, Trump commented, Well, that's what's happening.  I mean, look, we have no law, we have no order when it comes to many things.  I mean, we're just talking about immigration. Overstaying visas is a whole part of it, Trump said, speculating that there are millions of people currently overstaying their visas in the United States.  We have no idea who s in our country.  You re going to have a very rude awakening one day in this country.  We have no idea who s in our country.

Actress and stand-up comedian Amy Schumer sits in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan.  5, to listen to President Barack Obama speak about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence.    The Senate's partisan squabbling and failure to agree upon four separate gun-related amendments after the deadliest shooting in modern U. S.  history last week in Orlando is no joke to comedian Amy Schumer. I am sickened by the cowardice of these people who are supposed to lead us, Schumer told POLITICO.  Their dedication seems to be only to dollar signs for their own pockets.  In November, we will remember who stood with the gun lobby, rather than their constituents, as we mourned for Orlando. Schumer joined the fight for stricter gun laws last summer after a man opened fire in a Louisiana theater showing her movie Trainwreck, teaming up with Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N. Y. )   who happens to be her second cousin   to call for measures like universal background checks.  After the shooting at a screening of Trainwreck last July, the deaths of Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson made gun violence in America a deeply personal issue for Amy, the show's executive producer Dan Powell told POLITICO.  She pledged to add her voice to those advocating for safer gun laws.  The show had already set a precedent in our first few seasons of covering political and social issues of importance to Amy, so it was a natural fit. Earlier this year, an episode of her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer skewered the gun lobby while calling for reform.  But the episode aired April 28 and aptly titled Welcome to the Gun Show, did not include one segment that the comedian's publicist told POLITICO was cut for time but is particularly relevant a week after 49 people were killed at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub and in the days after partisan divisions scuttled efforts to reform background checks and ensure suspected terrorists are not able to buy guns. Inside Amy SchumerThe edgy two-minute, 38-second sketch, titled Gun Lawyer and exclusively shared with POLITICO, parodies the usual lawyer TV commercials but takes an early grim turn. Have you been injured in a mass shooting or other gun crime? Do you want justice? the lawyer played by comedian Jon Benjamin says.  Hi, I m Toby Shrak of the law firm of Shrak & Murphy, but don t call me, because there s nothing I can do.  For over 20 years, my brother and I fought for our clients, victims of car accidents, medical malpractice, workplace harassment, lead poisoning, asbestos harassment. Since my brother caught a stray bullet at a mall shooting, I found out it s not even worth it to try to sue gun or ammo manufacturers because the law gives them almost complete immunity from liability, the character playing the lawyer said, before the faux commercial features testimonials from clients.  A coworker we laid off opened fire at my office with a semiautomatic weapon that the gun manufacturer had made incredibly easy to convert to a fully automatic machine gun.  I am disabled for life, so I called Shrak and Murphy, and they told me I was s t out of luck, a woman says. Another man says,  I tried to sue the manufacturers of a hollow-tip bullet that was designed to inflict as much pain as possible, but current law makes it impossible to sue for damages.  I even had to pay the ammo company s legal costs.  They don t call me 'Wow, Thanks for Nothing Shrak' for nothing, the lawyer says, before cutting to a person who says that he was doing a school shooting when I slipped on the wet floor near the cafeteria.  I sued the school district, and I won $500,000.  The video then becomes grainier and faded as a man bearing a striking resemblance to Shrak appears on-screen to talk about how he was shot at a mall by a recently hospitalized man who had purchased his weapon at a gun show. My brother tried to sue the gun dealer for selling him the gun before the background check came back.  But the law George W.  Bush signed made that impossible, so he can t avenge my death, the man says, as he removes his toupee to reveal that he is still Shrak, Or should I say,  I can avenge his death.   That s right.  It s me, Toby Shrak, the one who s still here and haunted by his uselessness.  If you ve been the victim of nearly any tragedy, you can call me and I ll get the money you deserve, unless you ve been the victim of a gun tragedy, in which case you can call me just to talk, Shrak says, as the spot cuts to a logo of the fake law firm.  I am here, and my brother s chair is always empty, because he s dead.  And I am getting old.  I m a lawyer, and I have an office and a phone.  Hablamos ingles.  Kevin Kane, the show's supervising producer, called the segment absurd but 100% true. Jon Benjamin's character has this morbid reluctance, Kane told POLITICO.  There is nothing he can do.  That's the narrative we have all been lulled to sleep by and it's the narrative, after Monday's vote, that no one is buying anymore.

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president and self-described  king of debt,  offered a glimpse into his deal-making playbook Wednesday morning as he defended himself from Hillary Clinton's attacks.  I m the king of debt.  I m great with debt.  Nobody knows debt better than me,  Trump told Norah O Donnell in an interview that aired on  CBS This Morning.    I ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don t work out I renegotiate the debt.  I mean, that s a smart thing, not a stupid thing.   How do you renegotiate the debt?  O Donnell followed up.  You go back and you say, hey guess what, the economy crashed,  Trump replied.   I m going to give you back half.  Clinton blasted Trump's economic views in a speech on Tuesday, accusing him of gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States by flirting with a default on the debt.  That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,  Clinton said.   Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.  You see, we pay our debts.  The real estate mogul countered that while he s benefited from taking on debt in his business dealings, the U. S.  is  sitting on a time bomb  with its national debt.  President Barack Obama has grown the debt, Trump said, and Clinton  doesn t have a clue  when it comes to debt reduction. In a different interview Wednesday morning on ABC's Good Morning America, Trump defended his use of bankruptcy laws in business dealings.  The GOP nominee, who has been through four corporate bankruptcies, said he has used brilliantly the laws of this country in the business world, but never in his personal life.  He said his history of bankruptcies is not unique within the business community.  I m running a business, you ve got to understand.  I m running a business, Trump said when asked if those bankruptcies had hurt average Americans.  I m running a business for myself, for my company, for my employees and for my family.  Trump, presented by O Donnell with reports from independent economists who say his proposals would balloon the national debt by $30 trillion, also said his plans would reverse the flow of corporations and jobs leaving the United States.  He said he would turn the U. S.  into an attractive destination for businesses by lowering tax rates.  Companies now are leaving the United States, corporate inversion, they re leaving the United States.  We have almost five trillion dollars sitting out there, they can t get the money back,  he said.   They can t bring it in because there s no mechanism to bring it back in and the tax is so high.  I m going to bring tremendous amount of money, tremendous amounts of jobs, tremendous amounts of companies.   Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president and self-described  king of debt,  offered a glimpse into his deal-making playbook Wednesday morning as he defended himself from Hillary Clinton's attacks.  I m the king of debt.  I m great with debt.  Nobody knows debt better than me,  Trump told Norah O Donnell in an interview that aired on  CBS This Morning.    I ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don t work out I renegotiate the debt.  I mean, that s a smart thing, not a stupid thing.   How do you renegotiate the debt?  O Donnell followed up.  You go back and you say, hey guess what, the economy crashed,  Trump replied.   I m going to give you back half.  Clinton blasted Trump's economic views in a speech on Tuesday, accusing him of gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States by flirting with a default on the debt.  That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,  Clinton said.   Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.  You see, we pay our debts.  The real estate mogul countered that while he s benefited from taking on debt in his business dealings, the U. S.  is  sitting on a time bomb  with its national debt.  President Barack Obama has grown the debt, Trump said, and Clinton  doesn t have a clue  when it comes to debt reduction. In a different interview Wednesday morning on ABC's Good Morning America, Trump defended his use of bankruptcy laws in business dealings.

I m going to bring tremendous amount of money, tremendous amounts of jobs, tremendous amounts of companies.                   Marco Rubio becomes the immediate frontrunner in a battleground race that Democrats had been slightly favored to win.   In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an 11th-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant frontrunner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election was too important for the GOP to potentially lose control of the Senate over.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn't hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a civil-fraud trial against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American whose experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments concerning the judge.  I most certainly strongly disagree and I found what he said offensive and I m glad he stopped saying it,  Rubio added. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Once virtually tied, Trump is now trailing Clinton by 8 points in the poll, which showed that 58 percent of voters thought his comments about the  Mexican  judge were racist.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Democrats didn t want to face Rubio in the general election and had hoped he would keep his promise and retire in January. But they see an upside.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democrats, and the GOP appears divided as its favored Senate candidate criticizes its presidential nominee.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it will critically damage his political career and make a 2020 White House bid far more difficult.  Obviously this is a decision he had to make,  said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Jon Tester of Montana.   I think that anytime you run for a position that s a fallback position, that s not good.  I think he has to explain the votes he missed, I think he has to explain why, after a mass shooting in Orlando, that he votes against a bill that would help stop that from happening. Other than that it s fine, Tester added sarcastically. Rubio dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  Patrick Murphy is someone who is not prepared to be U. S.  senator considering the magnitude of what we re facing now,  Rubio said.   He has no significant achievements in his entire life.  He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  In discussing Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation into a hedge fund he ran and suggested the Orlando congressman was corrupt.  Alan Grayson, if he were elected, the chances are he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office,  Rubio said.   He has huge ethical issues.  Both Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He has a right to run.  And we ll have a campaign.  I can tell you that in the Florida primary, the only person that supported Charlie Crist after he changed parties was him,  Rubio said.   So he ll have to answer for that.  Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate seat or seek reelection. Asked if he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  I m coming back to the Senate with full energy because I believe that our next senator has to be someone that, no matter who s elected president, will encourage them to make the right decisions and stand up to them when they re making the wrong decisions   even if they re from your own party.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most-unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most-competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  Rubio said. As Democrats looked more likely to take his seat, Rubio said he didn t want to be responsible for Sen.  Chuck Schumer becoming majority leader and allowing Clinton s Supreme Court nominees to sail through the Senate if she wins the presidency. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings June 12 when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling to fundraise and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he uns for president again. As for the weeks of rumors that he and Lopez-Cantera had struck a deal for him to get in the race before the Orlando shootings, Rubio said they were  completely false.   As evidence of that, Rubio has no ready campaign that he can unveil, although most of the former campaign workers from his 2016 presidential bid are ready to help out. Clint Reed will be Rubio s campaign manager and Todd Harris will serve as a strategic advisor to the campaign.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan will either work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential election bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the race.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio's decision moved the seat from a likely loss to an almost certain pick-up. It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority so it's a big development, McConnell said.  I'm just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had . . .  I'm pretty excited about itBut Rubio s fellow Florida Senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election.   He and I get along real well (but) I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect,  Nelson said.   I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.

Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz shake hands at a debate sponsored by Fox News at the Fox Theatre on March 3 in Detroit, Michigan.   Ted Cruz announced Wednesday that he will support Marco Rubio's re-election bid.  Marco is a friend and has been an ally in many battles we have fought together in the Senate, the Texas senator said in a statement.  I'm glad to support him in his bid for re-election. Marco is a tremendous communicator and a powerful voice for the American Dream, Cruz continued.  At this time of great challenges, we very much need strong leaders in the Senate who will fight to restore economic growth, to defend our constitutional liberties, and to ensure a strong national security for our nation.  Rubio announced earlier Wednesday that he had reversed his previous decision and would run for his Senate seat, two days before the filing deadline.  Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a world-class liar who may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her pathetic email and server statements, Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me, Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's rigged against the American people. In contrast, Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft, Trump said. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash, Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001, Trump said.  They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. Clinton does not have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office, Trump said. Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people, Trump sid to applause.  She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Trump used details from Clinton Cash, the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  (The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as false, right-wing attacks funded by the Koch brothers. )Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server, Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger, Trump continued.  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. He continued, National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, Trump said.  She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. Trump also alleged that Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State  threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, [yeah, I guess so and I wish the first time it was done correctly when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya, Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it, he said.   This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  Vowing to build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth and ensure the military will have the best technology and finest equipment, Trump promised massive new factories that will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know, he said.  I say, nobody knows it better.

We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. He continued, National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, Trump said.  She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. Trump also alleged that Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State  threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, [yeah, I guess so and I wish the first time it was done correctly when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya, Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it, he said.   This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  Vowing to build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth and ensure the military will have the best technology and finest equipment, Trump promised massive new factories that will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know, he said.  I say, nobody knows it better.                  House Democrats participate in a sit-in to demand a vote for gun control measures.   Courtesy Rep.  Donna Edwards' officeMore than two dozen House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor Wednesday in protest of GOP leadership's refusal to allow a vote on a gun control measure following the Orlando massacre. Led by Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. ), the civil rights icon, and more than 40 Democrats walked into the chamber just before noon and pledged to  occupy  the House floor until GOP leadership allowed a vote.  Democrats have tried numerous times over the past week to force a vote on a so-called no fly, no buy bill, which would bar terror suspects on the  no-fly list from purchasing guns.  We have been too quiet for too long,  Lewis said.   There comes a time when you have to say something.  You have to make a little noise.  You have to move your feet.  This is the time.  How many more mothers? How many more fathers need to shed tears of grief before we do something? Lewis continued, his voice rising in intensity.  Give us a vote.  Let us vote.  We came here to do our job.  We came here to work.  The protest seemed to catch Republicans off guard.  As another House Democrat prepared to speak, the GOP lawmaker presiding over the chamber suddenly declared the House was in recess and shut off microphones. Democrats including Reps.  Joe Crowley (N. Y. ), Donna Edwards (Md. ) and John Larson (Conn. ) then sat down on the floor by the front podium.  They began reading the names of those who died in the June 12 shooting at a Florida nightclub that left 49 dead and 53 wounded.  No bill, no break,  Democrats chanted, repeating recent demands that House GOP leaders cancel the upcoming House recess until they vote on gun control. Clyburn led a prayer, as members clasped hands in a circle.  How greatly we ache for those lives lost, those families destroyed, those communities that have been broken because of our refusal to speak up, stand up and support just laws that will ensure safety and security, Lewis said. We've had it.  We're not going to watch any more people in this country get slaughtered and do nothing! Rep.  Mike Doyle (D-Pa. ) yelled during the protest.  Break the shackles! Rep.  Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said at another point. Republicans showed no signs of bowing to Democrats' demand.  The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ), said in a statement.

John Bresnahan contributed.  They re leaderless, cash-poor and facing an impossibly tight deadline.  But Republican activists clamoring to block Donald Trump from the GOP nomination say they re suddenly in the midst of a Dump-Trump bump. News of the mogul s dismal fundraising and skeletal campaign staff has energized the ragtag band of delegates looking to unseat Trump as the party s nominee at next month s national convention.  A handful of Republican Party insiders, long dismissive of attempts to block Trump, are now more convinced that there will be a substantive effort to stop him.  It s implausible but not impossible given the unrest,  said Randy Evans, a Republican National Committeeman from Georgia. Throughout Tuesday, as Trump s campaign sought to quash concerns about his anemic fundraising and decision to fire campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, anti-Trump delegates seized on glimmers of hope. First, they snagged the endorsement of former U. S.  Sen.  Gordon Humphrey, who told POLITICO he ll work full-time to help encourage New England delegates to rebel against Trump and to connect his allies with mid-level GOP fundraisers who can sustain their push through the convention.  Later, Wisconsin Gov.  Scott Walker endorsed one of their preferred methods for stopping Trump: freeing all 2,472 Republican National Convention delegates to vote their conscience, rather than abiding by rules and state laws that bind them to support Trump.  Delegates are and should be able to vote the way they see fit,  Walker said, according to an Associated Press account. At the same time, Saul Anuzis, a top adviser to Ted Cruz s former presidential campaign who has long dismissed attempts to unhorse Trump, floated the notion that a Walker/Cruz ticket would provide the only political mix to tempt conservative delegates away from Trump at the convention. Delegates leading the stop-Trump efforts have largely been coordinated by New Jersey s Steve Lonegan   a former Cruz adviser   and Colorado s Kendal Unruh, a delegate serving on the convention s rules committee, a 112-member body that will set the terms of convention s nomination process.  They ve arranged two conference calls in the past week, including one on Sunday in which organizers claimed nearly 400 convention delegates and alternates participated.  Another is scheduled for this weekend.  If a candidate was going into a convention, they have their votes counted   making sure that their supporters are staying strong,  said Unruh.   [Trump doesn t have the infrastructure to do that.  He has no clue how many delegates he has.  We re getting his soft support.  Like Trump, the Republican National Committee has written off efforts by anti-Trump delegates.   There is no organized effort, strategy or leader of this so-called movement,  said RNC spokesman Sean Spicer in a Friday tweet.   It is nothing more than a media creation and a series of tweets. Spicer said Tuesday that his assessment of the group hasn t changed, despite their recent conference call and claims of momentum.  And a slew of RNC leaders agree with his assessment.  I believe it s empty talk.  I don t think they have the numbers,  said Solomon Yue, an RNC committeeman from Oregon and a member of the convention Rules Committee.   It s noise.  Talk is cheap   Show me your name. So far, only a few handfuls of anti-Trump delegates have volunteered to publicly advocate for stopping Trump at the convention.  And they haven t snagged the endorsements of any big-name elected officials or Republican donors that would inject momentum into their cause.  We have no big donors at all.  There s no big money people,  said Lonegan. But perhaps the greatest hole in their plan is the inability to agree on who should lead the Republican Party instead of Trump.   A lot of people who are making noise don t have any answers,  said Jonathan Barnett, an RNC committeeman from Arkansas.   They don t have a white knight.  They say there s a problem, but they don t have a solution.  Humphrey, for example, said he s hopeful that the effort results in John Kasich claiming the nomination, even though many of the drivers of the push backed Cruz during the primary.  The first thing, obviously, the sine qua non, is to stop Trump on the first ballot,  he said.   Then, I intend to split off lickety-split.  Humphrey, who calls Trump a  sociopath,  said he doesn t believe the effort requires a settled alternative to succeed.  Rather, he said, continued struggles by Trump s campaign will coalesce support around stopping him.  To my knowledge, there is no heavy-hitter as yet involved.  My opinion is, if this effort becomes more credible  and it has grown in credibility by leaps and bounds     it will become an easier sell and hopefully will attract one or more of these major donors who spent a lot of money during the primary season contributing to various pro-Cruz, pro-Rubio, pro- Kasich people.  Their efforts are centered around multiple strategies that will require a complex level of organization the group hasn t yet shown.  One would require recruiting at least half of the 112-member convention rules committee to approve a  conscience clause,  permitting delegates bound to Trump to invoke a moral objection to free themselves and support another candidate.  Unruh is spearheading this effort. If she succeed on the committee   an enormously uphill battle   the measure would still need to win approval on the convention floor from a majority if the 2,472 delegates present. But Even if Unruh fails to mobilize enough support on the rules committee, she can still create a headache for Trump by pushing for a  minority report.   Just a quarter of the rules committee   28 members   can ask the full convention to vote on her proposal.  Evans, the Georgia committeeman, suggested that there are already at least 22 anti-Trump members on the rules committee, so reaching the threshold for a minority report seems achievable.  All of the campaigns   Trump, the RNC, Cruz, the Never Trumpers   are making their respective arguments,  he said. Another method would require individual delegates to challenge existing party rules that purport to bind them to the results of state primaries and caucuses.  That effort has been championed by North Dakota RNC Committeeman Curly Haugland, who s argued for years that delegates can t be bound to any particular candidate. Bill Bruch, a Washington state delegate who is part of the anti-Trump drive, said he called Haugland earlier this month to learn more about the nuances of his argument.  Now, he says, at least seven of Washington state s 44 delegates have signed on   names he said would be publicly released soon   to the effort.  Bruch said he s prepared to challenge any attempt by Washington GOP leaders to declare the delegation s full support for Trump at the convention.  But during nomination roll call votes, states are called alphabetically, he noted, so it may already be clear whether Trump will be the nominee by the time it s his state s turn.  He said states like California and Colorado will clarify the situation first.  If for some reason we can t get a nominee other than Trump, we might abstain,  he said.  They re leaderless, cash-poor and facing an impossibly tight deadline.

Newt Gingrich told delegates who don't support Donald Trump to protect the party.   Republicans who cannot support Donald Trump as the party's nominee should skip next month's convention in Cleveland, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday, tearing into factions of the party for appearing ignorant of national and even global political attitudes. You know, if you can t vote for the nominee of the party and the person who got the votes, don t go to the convention, Gingrich said during a Facebook livestream on a trip to Hungary with his wife, Callista.  Don t think you can safely get away with imposing your values, your judgment, your wisdom on the people of the United States.  That era s over, and in fact, you re going to look very foolish arguing that the voters   your voters   back home don t count because you re so much smarter. Even as Republicans have lamented the Democratic superdelegate process as hurting Bernie Sanders, Gingrich remarked that some of our friends want to create elite delegates in the Republican Party. An elite delegate is a person who says,  You know, I m so smart and my judgment s so good, I don t care what the voters back home say.  I don t care who they voted for.  You re telling me that Donald Trump got 13. 5 million votes, I don t care.  You tell me it s the most votes any Republican has ever got, I don t care.  After all, why should I listen to the people when I have my elitist superior wisdom,' Gingrich said, characterizing the position of a Republican opposed to Trump. That is not likely to go well, Gingrich said, urging his fellow party members to not decide that you re smarter than the American people. While House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) said he would not advocate for members of his party to violate their conscience in supporting Trump, Gingrich continued, he has also said the presumptive Republican nominee won this thing fair and square. Voters could have picked Cruz, Marco Rubio (whose decision to run for Senate re-election earned Gingrich's praise) or John Kasich, the former speaker said, but fact is, they didn t. Now for people to come along and say,  you know, I don t actually care what the Republican voters say,  cause I m going to impose my elite position, my superior wisdom,' Let me tell ya, Gingrich warned.  That is exactly what the country is rebelling against, that is exactly the attitude that led to the victory of the two women reformers in Italy this week, that s exactly the attitude that crushed the two traditional parties in Austria a couple weeks ago, he said, referring to recent European elections delivering a jolt to the establishment. We're having a remarkable trip, Gingrich said, as the feed ended.                  Newt Gingrich told delegates who don't support Donald Trump to protect the party.

We're having a remarkable trip, Gingrich said, as the feed ended.  House Republicans on a powerful spending committee rejected an amendment to limit the sale of firearms to terrorist suspects Wednesday, just days after Senate Republicans blocked an identical amendment on the chamber floor.  This policy could have made areal difference in Orlando,  said Rep.  Nita Lowey (D-N. Y. ), who introduced the amendment during a House Appropriations Committee mark up.  The measure would block firearms purchases by those who the Attorney General has a  reasonable suspicion  are engaged in terrorism. Republicans said the provision would violate due process rights for those seeking to buy firearms.  Democrats fired back by reciting the names and stories of some of the 49 victims of the June 12 massacre in Orlando, arguing that new gun controls are the best way to stop future bloodshed. After pointed back-and-forth, the measure was defeated, 16-31.  This list has been faulted for producing a high error rate in the past,  said Rep.  John Carter (R-Texas) of the terror watch list, urging his colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I cannot support a standard that is so inherently subjective, especially when it is used to deny a constitutional right.   But Democrats focused on the stories of some of Omar Mateen's victims in Orlando. Lowey spoke about Shane Tomlinson, 33, who was from her district.  He made everyone around him better.  His life was cut far too short,  she said.   He will be sorely missed but not forgotten.   Rep.  Jose Serrano (D-N. Y. ) spoke about Jonathan Antonio Camuy Vega, 24.  He had his whole life ahead of him,  Serrano said.   All his hopes, his dreams, his life gone in an instant.   Some Republican members compared the proposed measure to the internment of Japanese citizens by the US government during WWII, addressing such comparisons to Rep.  Mike Honda (D-Cal. ), who spent time in such an internment camp with his family.   Your liberty should never have been denied, and we shouldn t deny people s Second Amendment rights either,  Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) said to Honda, who disputed the comparison.   The government, I think, said they had  reasonable suspicion,  and therefore you were denied some rights, on the basis of  reasonable suspicion,   appropriations chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky. ) said to Honda, arguing that such reasonable suspicion should not be allowed to deny the right to purchase firearm. Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats for trampling on the constitution. Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) slammed the measure as taking away  one of the most fundamental rights Americans have.  Rep.  Andy Harris (R-Md. ) called the right to own a firearm  almost the definition of personal liberty.   I d rather my child be inconvenienced than dead,  Lowey said forcefully moments before the vote.                  Former Trump adviser Michael Caputo said the Trump campaign is now positive and optimistic.   Donald Trump's crisply argued, largely teleprompter-reliant speech taking down Hillary Clinton is a positive sign of things to come, the presumptive Republican nominee's former adviser Michael Caputo said Wednesday. Affirming that he still supports Trump despite his resignation after tweeting Ding Dong the witch is dead! following news of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's firing, Caputo told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports that the campaign's changes have created the most positive, the most optimistic moment in the Trump campaign since its loss in the Wisconsin primary in early April. I think people on Capitol Hill that you were talking about earlier, the folks who watching the campaign very closely, are about to see the kind of campaign that Donald Trump really deserves, Caputo said, adding that the slow start in fundraising might be revealing a little mechanical lag.  Things are going to turn around very quickly. Asked whether Trump needs to be better staffed and more careful about the charges he is lobbing against Clinton, as well as whether the candidate has a responsibility to be more precise, Caputo bristled. I think you'll see more and more precision in his speeches as we go forward.  You'll see more and more of the teleprompter coming out front.  But just because David Brock's Hillary Clinton PAC sends you corrections to Donald Trump doesn't mean he's always on the up and up either, Caputo said, in reference to rapid-response emails from the Clinton ally's Correct the Record.  We'll all going to be fact checked through this process.  I look forward to fact checking Hillary Clinton, too, and I hope you'll pay just as much attention to her.                  Sens.  Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz shake hands at a debate sponsored by Fox News at the Fox Theatre on March 3 in Detroit, Michigan.   Ted Cruz announced Wednesday that he will support Marco Rubio's re-election bid.  Marco is a friend and has been an ally in many battles we have fought together in the Senate, the Texas senator said in a statement.  I'm glad to support him in his bid for re-election. Marco is a tremendous communicator and a powerful voice for the American Dream, Cruz continued.  At this time of great challenges, we very much need strong leaders in the Senate who will fight to restore economic growth, to defend our constitutional liberties, and to ensure a strong national security for our nation.  Rubio announced earlier Wednesday that he had reversed his previous decision and would run for his Senate seat, two days before the filing deadline.                  A Donald Trump supporter (left) and a protester argue before the candidate's arrival in West Chester, Ohio, on March 13.  Democratic and Republican views of the opposing political party have sunk to such lows that many say their rivals make them feel afraid, according to an opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center.   The partisan divide among Democrats and Republicans has intensified to its highest level in nearly 25 years, according to a Pew Research Center study released Wednesday. For the first time since 1992, majorities of Democrats and Republicans have  very unfavorable  views of the opposing party.  While just 37 percent of Democrats and 32 percent of Republicans had very unfavorable views of the opposing party in 2008, the animosity has grown so much that 55 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans now say they have very unfavorable views of the other party. But the negative feelings don t stop there.  A majority of Democrats say they are fearful of (55 percent) and frustrated by (58 percent) the GOP, and 47 percent say they are angered by the Republican Party. The feelings, however, are largely mutual.  Nearly 50 percent of Republicans say they are afraid of the Democratic Party, with 57 percent saying they are frustrated and 46 percent expressing anger. The frustration among Democrats and Republicans surveyed is consistent with the levels of frustration among partisans who say they re highly politically engaged   meaning they always or nearly always vote and have volunteered for or contributed to a campaign in the past year.  But highly engaged partisans are more afraid of (Democrats, 70 percent; Republicans, 62 percent) and angry at (Democrats, 58 percent; Republicans, 58 percent) the other party. In terms of policy, partisanship prevails over bipartisanship.  Forty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans said they  almost never  agree with their party policy stances, while 2 in 10 Democrats and just 16 of Republicans  almost always  agree with their party positions. In fact, partisans say they increasingly perceive that the opposing party s policies are a threat to the nation.  In 2014, for example, among those who expressed very unfavorable views of the other party, 31 percent of Democrats and 37 percent of Republicans said the opposing party s  policies are so misguided that they threaten the nation s well-being.   Forty-one percent of Democrats and 45 percent of Republicans with very unfavorable views of the other party see that party s polices as a threat to America. Nearly 7 in 10 Democrats cite the party s policies being good for America as the  major reason  they identify with the Democratic Party, while 62 percent say a major reason they re Democrats is because GOP policies are bad.  Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans, however, attribute their negative views of Democratic policies as the major reason they identify as Republicans.  Sixty-four percent cited the Republican Party s policies as their major reason for being a Republican. Both parties do agree on at least one thing, though: that members of the other party are closed-minded.  An overwhelming 7 in 10 Democrats say Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans, while 52 percent of Republicans feel the same way regarding Democrats.  A high number of Democrats also say Republicans are more dishonest (42 percent), immoral (35 percent) and unintelligent (33 percent), while Republicans counter that Democrats are more immoral (47 percent), lazy (46 percent), dishonest (45 percent) and unintelligent (32 percent) than other Americans. Independents also lean away from a party more than they lean toward it.  A majority of Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning independents lean toward one of the major parties because they believe the other party s policies are bad for the country.  In contrast, just about 30 percent (30 percent, Republican leaners; 34 percent, Democratic leaners) lean toward a party because its policies are good for the country. Fifty-one percent of respondents say they find conversations about politics with people they disagree with  interesting and informative,  though 46 percent find it  stressful and frustrating.   But the discourse usually makes things worse.  More than 6 in 10 respondents say they tend to find out they have less in common politically than they thought, while 36 percent say they usually find out they have more in common politically than they thought. The study of partisanship and political animosity surveyed 4,385 adults online and via mail from March 2-28 and April 5-May 2 (before Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump became their parties  presumptive presidential nominees) on Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel.  The margin of error for those results is plus or minus 2. 3 percentage points.  Other results from Pew's report came from telephone interviews conducted April 12-19, surveying a national sample of 2,008 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2. 5 percentage points.                  Hillary Clinton said the American economy has failed many of Donald Trump's supporters.   Hillary Clinton hears Donald Trump's supporters loud and clear.  I respect the fear, the anxiety, even the anger that a lot of people are feeling,  the presumptive Democratic nominee told The Washington Post in an interview published Wednesday,  because the advance of globalization and technology has really replaced or undermined the future for many jobs.  Americans feel that the economy and government have failed them, Clinton told the Post, ahead of an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she is expected contrast her economic vision with Trump's. They just are looking for somebody who will explain, in a way they will accept, what s happened, Clinton said.  So Trump comes along and he blames immigrants and he blames minorities and he blames women, and people are responsive to that because these are hard times that folks are going through.  Clinton remarked upon anxieties of the white working class in the interview, particularly those of men, saying, I think it's real.  You don t have to go just to coal country to see that,  Clinton said.   You can go to a lot of parts of America, where people had good, decent jobs that provided a good middle-class life for them and their kids.  That was the American Dream.  That s how we used to define it.  The former secretary of state has ground to make up among white voters, who in a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday supported Trump 51 percent to 38 percent in a head-to-head matchup.  Clinton also trailed Trump by significant margins among white voters in a trio of Quinnipiac University polls surveying registered voters in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania.  Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a campaign rally December 2, 2015, in Manassas, Virginia.  Hillary Clinton s tenure as secretary of state produced a more turbulent, dangerous Middle East and birthed the Islamic State terrorist group responsible for violent attacks around the world, Donald Trump said Wednesday. Trump attacked Clinton on one of her strongest resume points, her tenure as America s chief diplomat, in a much-anticipated speech outlining her deficiencies as a candidate for president.  No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton, he said during the address, held at his Trump SoHo hotel. Trump contrasted the world before Clinton took over in Foggy Bottom with the one she left behind after stepping down in 2013.  Libya and Syria were stable and Iraq was growing safer, Trump said, before Clinton took the reins.  Under her watch, Trump said, all three became a haven for extremists as a result of mismanaged American foreign policy.  Clinton, Trump said, opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam. He accused Clinton of sleeping soundly during the terrorist attack against the U. S.  consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, and of lying to cover up the truth about his death.  As secretary of state, the presumptive GOP nominee said, Clinton  managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.   But Clinton s record of destructive foreign policy began much earlier, he said   when she was a senator representing New York.  Trump noted that she supported George W.  Bush s 2003 decision to invade Iraq and depose dictator Saddam Hussein   a position she has since disavowed.  He reiterated his claim that he ha opposed the war in Iraq from its very onset, an assertion that has been repeatedly been proven untrue.  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama,  Trump said.   In short, Hillary Clinton s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.                   Donald Trump waves to supporters as he arrives to speak at a rally on June 18, 2016, in Phoenix.   Donald Trump on Wednesday added another endorser from official Washington: Linda M.  Springer, the director of the U. S.  Office of Personnel Management from 2005 to 2008.  I am delighted to offer my endorsement of Donald Trump for President.  He is a proven leader with the strength and determination essential to address the critical challenges our country is facing, said Springer, the eighth director of the government agency responsible for overseeing the federal workforce, in a statement released through the campaign.  His commitment to America and repairing our ills has inspired millions.  I look forward to joining with them in supporting this historic movement and the candidate who can bring a fresh perspective to Washington, D. C.    Donald J.  Trump.  Trump welcomed her support, referring to her service as a leader in federal government management issues who understands the need for an effective government that serves its constituents   the citizens of our country.  I welcome her input to our team.   Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president and self-described  king of debt,  offered a glimpse into his deal-making playbook Wednesday morning as he defended himself from Hillary Clinton's attacks.  I m the king of debt.  I m great with debt.  Nobody knows debt better than me,  Trump told Norah O Donnell in an interview that aired on  CBS This Morning.    I ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don t work out I renegotiate the debt.  I mean, that s a smart thing, not a stupid thing.   How do you renegotiate the debt?  O Donnell followed up.  You go back and you say, hey guess what, the economy crashed,  Trump replied.   I m going to give you back half.  Clinton blasted Trump's economic views in a speech on Tuesday, accusing him of gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States by flirting with a default on the debt.  That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,  Clinton said.   Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.  You see, we pay our debts.  The real estate mogul countered that while he s benefited from taking on debt in his business dealings, the U. S.  is  sitting on a time bomb  with its national debt.  President Barack Obama has grown the debt, Trump said, and Clinton  doesn t have a clue  when it comes to debt reduction. In a different interview Wednesday morning on ABC's Good Morning America, Trump defended his use of bankruptcy laws in business dealings.  The GOP nominee, who has been through four corporate bankruptcies, said he has used brilliantly the laws of this country in the business world, but never in his personal life.  He said his history of bankruptcies is not unique within the business community.  I m running a business, you ve got to understand.  I m running a business, Trump said when asked if those bankruptcies had hurt average Americans.  I m running a business for myself, for my company, for my employees and for my family.  Trump, presented by O Donnell with reports from independent economists who say his proposals would balloon the national debt by $30 trillion, also said his plans would reverse the flow of corporations and jobs leaving the United States.  He said he would turn the U. S.  into an attractive destination for businesses by lowering tax rates.  Companies now are leaving the United States, corporate inversion, they re leaving the United States.  We have almost five trillion dollars sitting out there, they can t get the money back,  he said.   They can t bring it in because there s no mechanism to bring it back in and the tax is so high.  I m going to bring tremendous amount of money, tremendous amounts of jobs, tremendous amounts of companies.                   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi walks with Hillary Clinton to a House Democratic Caucus meeting on June 22, 2016.   John Shinkle Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton got a raucous welcome from House Democrats on Wednesday during her first visit to Capitol Hill since clinching the nomination. Entering the meeting to chants of Hillary, Hillary! The theme of the day was one word - unity, unity, and more unity.  We need to unify the country, Clinton said to applause. Invited to address rank-and-file lawmakers by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (Calif. ), Clinton told Democrats that she will compete in all 50 states and coordinate as much as possible with Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents. But Clinton also noted that battleground states will get her most attention, as would be expected.  I mean, I've been to Ohio three times, Clinton said, according to a Democratic lawmaker. Clinton also spoke about how she unified Democrats in 2008 following her long, bitter primary battle with now President Barack Obama, even though some of her supporters urged her to continue opposing Obama.  Clinton noted she stopped the roll call vote during the convention that year, demonstrating her support for Obama. While Democrats have nowhere near the turmoil that Republicans face over Donald Trump, Clinton and Democratic leaders must work to win over the progressive wing of the party, which had strongly supported Sen.  Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt. ) bid for the nomination.  While Sanders had only a fraction of Clinton's support among House Democrats, party officials are keenly aware that they need Bernie voters to win in November. Clinton also told Democrats   and it was music to their ears   that she wants to win back control of the House and Senate. It's about House Democrats taking back the House, [Democrats taking back the Senate, said Rep.  Gregory Meeks (D-N. Y. ).  It's not just about her, it's about all of us. The fact that she recognized that down ballot races were in play was great.  That recognition was very well received, added Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ). Not giving up on potential gains in the South, which is overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, pleased some Democrats, although the reality is that any such effort is unlikely to yield much barring a total Trump collapse. In other words, don't write off the South, said Rep.  Elijah Cummings (D-Md. )There were some light moments in the meeting as well.  When Becerra   who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick   offered Clinton some water, Rep.  Joe Crowley joked, Man, you're really working it.  The Democrats erupted in laughter.  And Pelosi gave Clinton a gift for her new grandson. While Clinton mentioned Trump during her appearance, there was little focus on the presumptive Republican nominee. Instead, Democrats played up their cohesion coming out of the Wednesday's session, as compared to what's happening with their GOP counterparts. What we saw in that room just now was a person who is extraordinarily competent, extraordinary able, said Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md. )People who are representatives in the democratic caucus, we really like our candidate.  We really like our candidate, Crowley said.  The New York Democrat said he would love to be a fly on the wall when House Republicans meet with Trump on July 7. Republicans responded to the Clinton visit by issuing statements bashing the Democratic standard-bearer, and GOP leadership aides noted privately that the Benghazi committee   chaired by Rep.  Trey Gowdy (R-S. C. )   is still drafting its report on the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead, including the U. S.  ambassador to Libya.

A man who claimed to be the lover of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen said the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub was motivated by revenge, not terrorism. In an interview with Univision, the man said Mateen was  100 percent gay  and that the two had carried on a  friends with benefits  relationship after meeting last year through a gay dating app.  He said he had reported his relationship with Mateen to the FBI and had been interviewed multiple times.  The FBI also confirmed to Univision that it has met with him. The man, who wore a disguise in his interview with Univision and was identified only as  Miguel,  said Mateen s attack at Orlando s Pulse nightclub was the result of a sexual encounter with two Latino men, one of which Mateen later discovered was HIV positive.  The attack, carried out at the nightclub s Latino night, was Mateen s attempt at taking revenge against a specific community of gay men who he felt had used and rejected him, the man said.  He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin, but he felt rejected.  He felt used by them.  There were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad.  Guys used him.  That really affected him,  Miguel told Univision.  I believe this crazy horrible thing he did, that was revenge. Miguel described Mateen as a  very sweet guy  who  loved to be cuddled  and frequented gay bars.  He said he was stunned when he discovered Mateen had been the shooter at Pulse, that it was  impossible that the man I know could do that.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said investigators are still looking into Mateen's contacts from the months leading up to the attack.  We stand with you to say that the good in this world far outweighs the evil, that our common humanity transcends our differences, and that our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, it s unity, and it s love,  Lynch told reporters, specifically addressing the LGBT community, on Tuesday.   We stand with you today as we grieve together, and long after the cameras are gone, we will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment, in solidarity, and in equality.

If Clinton s allies have their way on Wednesday when Trump delivers his long-awaited anti-Hillary speech, that won t be enough. A constellation of groups in the presumptive Democratic nominee s political orbit is prepping a wide-ranging response to Trump s downtown Manhattan speech   originally slated for New Hampshire last week before getting postponed following the Orlando mass shooting   that will include a series of memos, rapid response releases, and calculated silences designed to paint the Republican as both corrupt and a peddler of conspiracy theories. Recalling Trump s relative silence when Clinton attacked him in her first dedicated anti-Trump speech in San Diego earlier this month   they hope it will paint the picture of a prepared campaign squaring off against a floundering one. While the Clinton camp itself is not planning to any specific push against Trump s morning address at the Trump SoHo   it prefers to maintain a posture of not responding to each of Trump s frequent Clinton barbs -- people close to the anti-Trump operation are hoping that her own economic policy speech here in North Carolina will provide enough of a contrast to send a message to voters. The Clinton Foundation, however, is poised to respond to what it deems false allegations about its operations    likely about its foreign fundraising practices   on social media, and also to distribute positive stories and first-hand accounts of its work, foundation officials told POLITICO.

Trump will also lie about Hillary Clinton today as he has lied about her before.

They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race, said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank, said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was almost so low that it's not even comprehendable.  After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading THE FIRST ONE.  Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort, said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.  By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.  I was very involved in Mitt Romney's fundraising effort in 2008, and immediately after he got out of the primary he got his team together and he said we all need to get behind John McCain, and I ended up raising more money that year for John McCain than I did for Mitt Romney by the time the election ended, Tanenblatt said.  There wasn't that effort with regard to the Trump campaign because the Trump campaign didn't raise money on their own and didn't reach out to supporters of the other candidates like donors are accustomed.  Typically, the nominee is the one who is magnanimous and reaches out to the supporters of the other campaigns and unifies and works to unify the party.  I don't think that happened to the extent it should have. Defending his campaign's financial situation on Tuesday, Trump pointed out that he could simply reach into his own wallet if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Still, those who worked for Trump's vanquished rivals, while fretting that Clinton s war chest so dramatically eclipses Trump's, were unable to resist the temptation to knock the real estate mogul's funding strategy.  I thought he was self funding? ;), a chief strategist for one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump early in the GOP primary wrote in an email.  Several Republicans argued that it's unlikely that the GOP donor class will make a mad rush to close the money gap between Clinton and Trump, since there's still a strong distaste for Trump among some donors.  Those feelings go both ways: One Republican donor who recently met with then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recalled him suggesting that Trump strongly disliked asking major GOP donors for money. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the donors that have been loyal Republican supporters over the past few election cycles have been vilified by Trump, and he said that he could win without them and was going to self-fund, so they're not inspired to jump on board with significant donations, said Spies.  What would possibly move them to support him would be across-the-board enthusiasm about the nominee or a bandwagon effect.  I mean, if all your friends are giving, you don't want to be left out, but this number is an indication that none of your friends are giving, so why would you be the guy out front supporting Trump when nobody else is?A former bundler for Jeb Bush was even more direct about his disinterest in helping Trump.  This is a guy who lent himself $30 [million or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back.  This is a total fraud.  He's a fraud, the former Bush bundler said, referring to the fact that Trump loaned his campaign the cash and could still repay himself.  There's a universe of, I don't know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who's not going to [contribute.  So that's part of it.  And I think we're just not going to stick our necks out for that.  This isn't a situation like Ben Carson, where he's blowing through money like nobody's business.  I don't think that s blowing through tons of money.  They didn't have a huge staff to begin with.  They're not fully staffed to run a national campaign. The question now, Tanenblatt said, is what Trump does going forward in terms of picking a vice-presidential candidate and what he says in public.  That could determine whether his fundraising picks up or not.  I think that says a lot about him as a candidate,  Tanenblatt said.   That's probably the biggest decision that he's going to make in the campaign, so that will send a signal.  David Tamasi, a former fundraiser for New Jersey Gov.  Chris Christie's presidential campaign, stressed that it's still a long way until Election Day, and he said Republicans shouldn t read too much into May fundraising numbers.  It's easy to look at May and compare that to somebody who's had a 25-year start to make some sort of comparison, none of which are flattering, but I think it's an inaccurate portrayal of where things will be once things get hot, Tamasi said.  As Donald Trump gears up for his all-out war on Hillary and Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican nominee on Wednesday is planning to draw ammunition from the controversies that have dogged the family, and particularly its Clinton Foundation, for years.  I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Trump tweeted Tuesday, teasing out an address scheduled for Trump SoHo in New York, a day after Clinton laced into his economic and business acumen. Trump initially planned to deliver a speech, originally scheduled for June 13 in New Hampshire, discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.  But after the Orlando attack, Trump instead refocused that address on national security.  Now, he'll be back on the attack   helped by four decades' worth of statements, association, innuendo and scandal.  And the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which has been embroiled in political controversy from its inception in 1997, is going to be at the top of Trump's target list.  Before Clinton even formally announced her campaign last spring, conservative author Peter Schweizer was writing Clinton Cash, digging into the foundation's financial dealings and connections.  Less than a month into her run, questions resurfaced about a series of issues related to the foundation, from troublesome tax returns to myriad donations from countries with less than stellar human rights records.  And while the media frenzy has subsided somewhat in 2016, Trump's early line of attack suggests that as organization Bill Clinton describes as one that has done a lot of good things is about to be dragged back into a turbulent political season. In a sneak preview of the coming battle royale, Trump declared that Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund, during a speech June 7 at his Westchester County golf club.  On Tuesday, Trump's rapid-response effort kicked into high gear, firing off multiple tweets, posts and emails seeking to undercut Clinton's argument that he would be disastrous for the economy while promoting his own policies.  And he accused the former first couple of laundering money and making hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts. There's sure to be more.  Here is a pocket guide to where Trump might attack:Tuesday's warningAs Clinton finished up her speech laying into Trump's economic policies, the Republican's burgeoning rapid-response unit sent forth an avalanche of emails, tweets and social media posts critiquing both the candidate and former president for a series of misdeeds, ranging from instances of alleged personal impropriety to broad responsibility for the state of the American economy. In the first of nine emails sent out directly before, during and minutes after the former secretary of state spoke to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, Trump's campaign pointed out that Mark Zandi, an economist who Clinton pointed out in her address advised McCain, had donated to the Democratic candidate and had his policies praised by the current administration. Another email sought to link Tuesday's news that Boeing had reached an agreement with Iran's largest airline as a consequence of the Iranian nuclear deal, stating, Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terror, would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. Trump's campaign later attacked Clinton's lack of poise under pressure in response to her argument that he lacks the proper temperament to be president, referring to a forthcoming book by a former Secret Service agent who wrote that what he saw in the 1990s sickened me. A later email alleged that as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to her husband through organization Laureate Education while he was still an honorary chairman for the educational for-profit organization. The White House ethics agreementFoundation officials disclosed in February 2015 that one donation made during Clinton s time at Foggy Bottom violated the ethics agreement the foundation had signed with the Obama administration. The agreement was reached in 2008, before Clinton was nominated as secretary of state, as the incoming White House expressed concern about countries using the foundation to leverage political favor from the State Department.  The memo did not ban donations from foreign countries with a stake in U. S.  interests, with one exception.  The agreement blocked donations to the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosts the fancy annual Clinton Foundation event starring the former president and other world leaders.  In the one instance acknowledged as a violation more than a year ago, foundation officials said they should have submitted a $500,000 donation in 2010 from the Algerian government for its Haiti earthquake relief fund to the State Department for approval.  This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed.  This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since,  a spokesman told POLITICO at the time. Should Hillary Clinton be elected president, [there'll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it, Bill Clinton told Bloomberg TV on June 14, echoing what the campaign has said. The donations that  slipped through the cracks The day after Trump promised to unleash on the foundation, Clinton and her surrogates began a two-day media blitz.  During the first day of that press tour, they answered multiple questions about disclosure surrounding their donors, remarking that the organization went above and beyond requirements in an effort to be transparent. We had absolutely overwhelming disclosure,  she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.   Were there, you know, one or two instances that slipped through the cracks? Yes.  But was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed? Absolutely.  The time a donor got on a sensitive intelligence boardRajiv K.  Fernando, a Democratic donor and Chicago securities trader who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board in 2011 despite lacking the qualifications of his colleagues.   We had no idea who he was,  one board member said, according to a June 10 ABC News report.  ABC's report detailed emails its journalists obtained from Citizens United through the Freedom of Information Act.  The emails further reveal how, after inquiries from ABC News, the Clinton staff sought to  protect the name  of the Secretary,  stall  the ABC News reporter and ultimately accept the resignation of the donor just two days later,  ABC reported. The emails provided to ABC, according to the report, showed a State Department official unable to immediately answer why Fernando was on the panel.  The true answer is simply that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him,  Wade Boese, who was Chief of Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, wrote in an email to press aide Jamie Mannina, according to ABC s report.   Raj was not on the list sent to S [secretary of state; he was added at their insistence.  Emails released by the State Department as part of the court-ordered schedule do not explicitly show Clinton being involved in Fernando s placement.  In one email from 2010 provided to ABC with the subject line  ISAB,  shorthand for the organization, chief of staff Cheryl Mills wrote,  The secretary had two other names she wanted looked at.   The case of the errant tax returnsAs part of the renewed scrutiny on the Clinton Foundation in the spring of 2015, Reuters reported in April that a review showed errors in how it reported donations from foreign governments on its forms 990 from 2010 through 2012. The Clinton Foundation in November filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes, Clinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said in a statement at the time.  Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review.  The speaking fees, part IAlso on the heels of Schweizer s book came a report from ABC News in April 2015 that Bill Clinton s speaking fees had begun to double or triple after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. The report noted that the former president, who usually pulled down $150,000 per speech after leaving the White House, was paid $500,000 by a Russian investment bank and $750,000 to address a telecom conference in China. At a time when Bernie Sanders was pushing Clinton on her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, a CNN analysis in February found that the Clintons earned more than $153 million combined in 729 separate paid speeches from February 2001 until May 2015. The speaking fees, part IIThe same week other outlets were reporting on Schweizer s findings, The Washington Post s Rosalind Helderman reported that Bill Clinton took in at least $26 million to speak to organizations that have also donated to the foundation.  It s not surprising that organizations who believe strongly in the Clinton Foundation s mission and are impressed by its results are genuinely interested in President Clinton s perspective,  Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post at the time.   The president often says the foundation is his life today, and he welcomes any opportunity to educate people about it and encourage more people to work together to solve some of the most critical global challenges we all face.  In its analysis, the Post reported that among the approximately 420 organizations that paid Clinton to speak between 2001 and 2013, 67 of them also donated at least $10,000 each to the charity. The Russian uranium dealAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton sat on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which had before it a request to approve the sale of U. S.  uranium stock to Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom as part of a transitioned takeover of a company which through an earlier merger had acquired U. S.  uranium interests. Following on Schweizer s research, The New York Times reported in April 2015 that Canadian businessman Frank Giustra had acquired uranium interests during a 2005 trip to Kazakhstan with Bill Clinton.  Giustra, whose up and coming UrAsia merged with the South African company Uranium One in 2007, gave more than $31 million to the foundation in 2006 and pledged $100 million more. Rosatom took over 17 percent of Uranium One in 2009, increasing to 51 percent in 2010 and the rest of the company in 2013.  Ian Telfer, who chaired Uranium One at the time of its acquisition by Rosatom, donated $2. 35 million in four separate gifts through his family foundation. Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown, the Times reported in the article.  But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation s donors. The UBS dealThe Wall Street Journal reported last July that Clinton intervened on behalf of Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which the Internal Revenue Service was suing to get the identities of Americans with offshore accounts. After that intervention in 2009, donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation increased from less than $60,000 to a total of $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the Journal s report.  Additionally, the bank lent $32 million to the foundation to jumpstart its entrepreneurship and inner-city loan program, and Bill Clinton received $1. 5 million to do question-and-answer sessions with UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Bob McCann. However, the Journal s report acknowledges that there is  no evidence of any link between Mrs.  Clinton s involvement in the case and the bank s donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, or its hiring of Mr.  Clinton,  while characterizing it as a  prime example of how the Clintons  private and political activities overlap.    Any suggestion that she was driven by anything but what s in America s best interest would be false.  Period,  a Clinton campaign spokesman told the Journal at the time. The foreign donationsAfter Clinton left office in 2013, the foundation lifted its ban on donations from foreign governments.  The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that recent donors to the foundation included the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, Germany and a Canadian government agency seeking the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. As recently as this month, Bernie Sanders seized upon the foreign donations in questioning in the judgment of Clinton to be commander in chief. If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are dictatorships  yeah, I do, Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview aired June 5. Asked whether the foundation's ongoing activities presented an ongoing conflict of interest, Sanders responded, Yes, I do. Trump himself has openly boasted that Sanders' lines about Clinton's paid speeches would be useful fodder in a general election bout, even as the Vermont senator has vowed to do everything in his power to keep the presumptive Republican nominee from the White House. Five days before Clinton declared victory in the Democratic primary, Trump tweeted, Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!On Tuesday, the Trump campaign said that the foundation had accepted between approximately $21. 3 million and $65. 5 million from the governments of countries with policies hostile toward women's rights, gay rights and human rights, including Algeria, Brunei, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Friends of Saudi Arabia organization and the Zayeds, the ruling family of the Emirates. Promoting his major speech, Trump told supporters on the night of the final Republican primaries, I think you re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.  I wonder if the press will want to attend.  Who knows? As Donald Trump gears up for his all-out war on Hillary and Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican nominee on Wednesday is planning to draw ammunition from the controversies that have dogged the family, and particularly its Clinton Foundation, for years.

Promoting his major speech, Trump told supporters on the night of the final Republican primaries, I think you re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.  I wonder if the press will want to attend.  Who knows?                 A fundraising email from the Trump campaign said they raised $2 million in 12 hours.   Donald Trump Jr.  said Wednesday the Trump campaign raised $2 million in 12 hours. In an email to supporters, Trump's oldest son said the campaign hit the mark after sending out its first fundraising email on Tuesday.  In that appeal, Donald Trump has also said he would match the $2 million raised.  The campaign s fundraising efforts began after financial reports revealed Trump significantly trailed Hillary Clinton in funds as they both head into the general election.  Trump started the month of June with $1. 3 million in cash compared to Clinton s $42. 5 million. In Wednesday s email, Trump Jr.  continued the fundraising push, asking supporters to help his father defeat Clinton.   We all know what a disaster Crooked Hillary would be for this country if she were elected, he wrote in the email.  And the only way to stop her is to stand together and fight against her fraud and lies.   The email comes on the same day of the presumptive Republican nominee s speech, where he attacked Clinton for being a  world-class liar.                    Actress and stand-up comedian Amy Schumer sits in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan.  5, to listen to President Barack Obama speak about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence.    The Senate's partisan squabbling and failure to agree upon four separate gun-related amendments after the deadliest shooting in modern U. S.  history last week in Orlando is no joke to comedian Amy Schumer. I am sickened by the cowardice of these people who are supposed to lead us, Schumer told POLITICO.  Their dedication seems to be only to dollar signs for their own pockets.  In November, we will remember who stood with the gun lobby, rather than their constituents, as we mourned for Orlando. Schumer joined the fight for stricter gun laws last summer after a man opened fire in a Louisiana theater showing her movie Trainwreck, teaming up with Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N.

After the shooting at a screening of Trainwreck last July, the deaths of Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson made gun violence in America a deeply personal issue for Amy, the show's executive producer Dan Powell told POLITICO.  She pledged to add her voice to those advocating for safer gun laws.  The show had already set a precedent in our first few seasons of covering political and social issues of importance to Amy, so it was a natural fit. Earlier this year, an episode of her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer skewered the gun lobby while calling for reform.  But the episode aired April 28 and aptly titled Welcome to the Gun Show, did not include one segment that the comedian's publicist told POLITICO was cut for time but is particularly relevant a week after 49 people were killed at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub and in the days after partisan divisions scuttled efforts to reform background checks and ensure suspected terrorists are not able to buy guns. Inside Amy SchumerThe edgy two-minute, 38-second sketch, titled Gun Lawyer and exclusively shared with POLITICO, parodies the usual lawyer TV commercials but takes an early grim turn. Have you been injured in a mass shooting or other gun crime? Do you want justice? the lawyer played by comedian Jon Benjamin says.  Hi, I m Toby Shrak of the law firm of Shrak & Murphy, but don t call me, because there s nothing I can do.  For over 20 years, my brother and I fought for our clients, victims of car accidents, medical malpractice, workplace harassment, lead poisoning, asbestos harassment. Since my brother caught a stray bullet at a mall shooting, I found out it s not even worth it to try to sue gun or ammo manufacturers because the law gives them almost complete immunity from liability, the character playing the lawyer said, before the faux commercial features testimonials from clients.  A coworker we laid off opened fire at my office with a semiautomatic weapon that the gun manufacturer had made incredibly easy to convert to a fully automatic machine gun.  I am disabled for life, so I called Shrak and Murphy, and they told me I was s t out of luck, a woman says. Another man says,  I tried to sue the manufacturers of a hollow-tip bullet that was designed to inflict as much pain as possible, but current law makes it impossible to sue for damages.  I even had to pay the ammo company s legal costs.  They don t call me 'Wow, Thanks for Nothing Shrak' for nothing, the lawyer says, before cutting to a person who says that he was doing a school shooting when I slipped on the wet floor near the cafeteria.  I sued the school district, and I won $500,000.  The video then becomes grainier and faded as a man bearing a striking resemblance to Shrak appears on-screen to talk about how he was shot at a mall by a recently hospitalized man who had purchased his weapon at a gun show. My brother tried to sue the gun dealer for selling him the gun before the background check came back.  But the law George W.  Bush signed made that impossible, so he can t avenge my death, the man says, as he removes his toupee to reveal that he is still Shrak, Or should I say,  I can avenge his death.   That s right.  It s me, Toby Shrak, the one who s still here and haunted by his uselessness.  If you ve been the victim of nearly any tragedy, you can call me and I ll get the money you deserve, unless you ve been the victim of a gun tragedy, in which case you can call me just to talk, Shrak says, as the spot cuts to a logo of the fake law firm.  I am here, and my brother s chair is always empty, because he s dead.  And I am getting old.  I m a lawyer, and I have an office and a phone.  Hablamos ingles.  Kevin Kane, the show's supervising producer, called the segment absurd but 100% true. Jon Benjamin's character has this morbid reluctance, Kane told POLITICO.  There is nothing he can do.  That's the narrative we have all been lulled to sleep by and it's the narrative, after Monday's vote, that no one is buying anymore.                  Actress and stand-up comedian Amy Schumer sits in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan.  5, to listen to President Barack Obama speak about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence.    The Senate's partisan squabbling and failure to agree upon four separate gun-related amendments after the deadliest shooting in modern U. S.  history last week in Orlando is no joke to comedian Amy Schumer. I am sickened by the cowardice of these people who are supposed to lead us, Schumer told POLITICO.  Their dedication seems to be only to dollar signs for their own pockets.  In November, we will remember who stood with the gun lobby, rather than their constituents, as we mourned for Orlando. Schumer joined the fight for stricter gun laws last summer after a man opened fire in a Louisiana theater showing her movie Trainwreck, teaming up with Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N. Y. )   who happens to be her second cousin   to call for measures like universal background checks.

That's the narrative we have all been lulled to sleep by and it's the narrative, after Monday's vote, that no one is buying anymore.  After losing big on gun control, yet again, this week, Democrats are shifting full-on to election mode.  Their argument: Only a Democratic Senate can make any headway on the issue.  But unless the GOP suddenly renounces the National Rifle Association, the vision of sweeping gun control that Democrats are selling to voters is probably an illusion   no matter who s running the chamber.  Even if Donald Trump produces a wave election for Democrats, there almost certainly won t be enough votes to clear the Senate s 60-vote threshold to pass universal background checks or other measures.  Even then, Republicans are strongly favored to keep the House, where any Senate-passed proposal would face even longer odds.  Democrats insist the political tide is turning their way   and the Senate is currently holding high-stakes negotiations on a narrow proposal to bar terrorists from buying guns after the shooting deaths of 49 people in Orlando, Florida.  But party leaders don t have an answer for how anything more far-reaching than that will become law.   I don t know what it s going to take,  said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill. ) in an interview.   It takes an election, as far I m concerned.   The hill might even by steeper than it appears: Sen.  Heidi Heitkamp (D-N. D. ) opposes a Democratic measure authorizing broader background checks, and three of the four GOP supporters of that proposal currently hold seats that Democrats are trying to win.  Democrats would need to pick up at least 15 seats to have enough votes to clear a filibuster on party lines   and even then there s no guarantee that the next class of Democratic senators will all support the party s efforts to make background checks mandatory or ban military-style assault weapons.  Plus Democrats are defending a number of red states in 2018, which would make vulnerable Democrats less than enthusiastic about antagonizing conservative voters in their states.  That tension was laid bare on Monday, when Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont. ) voted against a background checks proposal intended to place GOP senators on the wrong side of voters.  Tester, himself up for reelection in 2018, said he voted against his own party s background checks proposal because  they put some unnecessary stuff in that bill,  including provisions he said would excessively restrict transferring guns among family members.  But despite his own opposition, Tester still pointed to the GOP as the key obstacle in advancing gun measures.   As far as what we get, it s got to be bipartisan, of course, because it s going to be a 60-vote margin,  Tester said of prospects for gun measures in 2017.  Noting that only Sen.  Mark Kirk (R-Ill. ) voted with Democrats on background checks, Tester added:  That s where your problem is.   Tester was joined by Sen.  Joe Manchin (D-W-Va. ) and Heitkamp, who is working on a compromise gun measure with Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) to bar people on two key federal watch lists from obtaining firearms.  But the National Rifle Association came out in opposition on Tuesday, potentially dooming the measure just minutes after it was formally introduced.  The Democratic plan rejected on Monday was similar to a proposal that Manchin pushed three years ago with Sen.  Pat Toomey (R-Pa. ).  But the vote this time was more partisan.   If they were serious about making progress on this, I think they would have gone to the only bill I know of that has bipartisan support,  Toomey fumed on Tuesday.   That would have been a demonstration of good faith.   If Democrats defeat Toomey and other vulnerable senators and take the Senate, among the first decisions they ll face will be whether to charge into a divisive debate over gun control after campaigning on the issue and hammering Republicans for months.  Sen.  Chuck Schumer of New York, the presumptive Democratic leader next year, wouldn t say Tuesday how the party would prioritize gun control, saying only that  for two decades it s been an important issue  for the party.  But the leader of last week s high-profile filibuster is pressing Schumer to take a crack at gun laws early on if Democrats capture the Senate.   If it s not the first vote it should be at the very top of the list,  said Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ).   If Hillary wins and we have a Democratic Senate, there s an absolute, clear mandate to act on this issue of background checks and other measures to protect against gun violence.   Prospects are even dimmer for an assault weapons ban, another high priority for Democrats.  The ban that passed in 1993 garnered only 56 votes, a time when the 60-vote threshold was rarely employed.  (It expired after a decade. ) In theory, Democrats could tuck a gun control proposal into unrelated legislation using the arcane procedure of budget reconciliation or move to scuttle the chamber s supermajority requirement, which would make the Senate much more like the House, where the majority can run roughshod over the minority.  But no one s talking about pursuing either of those ideas: Even the most reform-hungry senators aren t interested in getting rid of supermajority rules on legislation.  And parliamentary tactics won t help clear the hurdle of the House, which even the most optimistic Democrats doubt will flip in November.  Still, Democrats believe the drumbeat of public pressure will become too great for Republicans to resist.  They say it s been evident in the flurry of negotiations that ensued after the Orlando shootings.  A recent CNN survey found 90 percent support for background checks.   Let s say they re in the majority.  Let s say they re at 54, 56, wherever we were before,  Manchin said, referring to the number of seats Senate Democrats control.   Then I think the chances are pretty darn good, and I think we can get something.  Sooner or later, something has to be done.   Democrats say movement over the past week is instructive.  Toomey and Sen.  Kelly Ayotte (R-N. H. ), who are both in tight reelection races, endorsed the compromise led by moderate Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine).   Clearly, it s the beginning of cracks on the vise-like grip of the NRA,  said Sen.  Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn. ), who s been aggressively pushing for new gun restructions.   It s the beginning of their grip breaking.   This week will be a major test of that thesis.  As Blumenthal spoke, the NRA was going into overdrive, whipping lawmakers against  any and all gun control    a reaction to the more modest bipartisan measure being pushed by Collins.  Senate GOP leaders are eyeing a vote as early as Thursday on a compromise proposal to bar people with terrorist ties from purchasing firearms, which would tee up yet another floor fight over gun policy just days after the chamber rejected four measures on the issue.  The plan, written by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) and a handful of deal-making senators, is still expected to draw notable Republican opposition because of how it's drafted.  Under her bill, someone who is unable to buy a gun gets to appeal that decision only after he or she has already been denied the purchase   a deal-breaker for many GOP lawmakers. Indeed, the National Rifle Association issued a statement Tuesday afternoon dismissing the bill   effectively ensuring that a flood of GOP lawmakers will oppose it.   Keeping guns from terrorists while protecting the due process rights of law-abiding citizens are not mutually exclusive,  said Chris Cox, the executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.   Unfortunately, Senator Collins and others are focusing their efforts on unconstitutional proposals that would not have prevented the Orlando terrorist attack.  One influential Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), said he could not support Collins  bill as written due to  concerns about the lack of due process on the front end.    But I m happy to work with them so we can move this to a place where we get the largest number of people,  said Cornyn, who said the chamber will vote on the measure on Thursday.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) said the measure would get a vote, but declined to commit to a firm date.  Still, Republican leaders aren t twisting arms on the vote, allowing members to vote their conscience. Democrats and Republican leaders were mostly non-committal on the emerging bipartisan proposal, with Cornyn highlighting Second Amendment concerns and Sen.  Chuck Schumer (D-N. Y. ) questioning why the bill isn t broader.  The likely Democratic leader in the next Congress said the bill is a  step in the right direction,  but then highlighted why it will be so difficult for Republicans to support: He proposed calling it the  Buck the NRA  bill.  Neither McConnell nor Minority Leader Harry Reid said whether they will support the legislation. A group of Republicans looking to strike a deal and several senators up for reelection met privately Tuesday morning with McConnell, Cornyn and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune Tuesday morning.  Sens.  Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire are joining Collins in pushing the compromise, along with centrist Democratic Caucus members like Sens.  Heidi Heitkamp (D-N. D. ) and Angus King (I-Maine).  Collins, Ayotte and Flake met with GOP leaders along with Republican Sens.  Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to gauge the prospects of the legislation. I've looked at every proposal, Rubio said as he headed into the meeting Tuesday.  If there is a way to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, I'm open to it. The Collins-led bill would prevent people on the no-fly list and the Secondary Security Screening Selectee list, which prompts extra security scrutiny at airports, from buying guns with an appeals process.  People who are on the broader terrorism watch list or have been within the past five years would be able to purchase firearms without being blocked, but the FBI would be notified.   Our goal is simple and straightforward: we want to make America safer,  Collins said at a news conference announcing her compromise.   All of us are united in our desire to getting something significant done on this vital issue.   Democrats also discussed the matter at a party lunch, where Heitkamp made the pitch to her colleagues on why they should embrace the Collins compromise.  Some Senate Democrats such as Bill Nelson of Florida, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico are supporting the compromise.  For her part, Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ) said Tuesday afternoon that she wanted to meet with Collins to flesh out some provisions in the Maine senator s bill that Feinstein wanted clarified.  Clearing the 60-vote threshold may be difficult with the election just under five months away and several Senate Republicans running tough reelection bids.  Collins  measure shares many of the same features as Feinstein s bill, which garnered 47 votes in favor on Monday night.  Portman said he was evaluating the Collins  plan but did not make commitments one way or the other.  Toomey, meanwhile, issued a statement Tuesday saying he would support it.  Other Republicans urged their GOP colleagues to back the compromise   and had tough words for the gun lobby.   To my friends at the NRA, I understand your concern about denying somebody the right to buy a gun, that s a constitutional right,  said Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ), who also supports the Collins measure.   But every right, whether it s speech or buying a weapon or any other constitutional right, has boundaries on it.                   Valerie Jarrett speaks on a stage at the White House Summit on the United State of Women on June 14.   Valerie Jarrett is increasingly asserting control of the administration s campaign to curtail gun violence   and she s not afraid of burning White House bridges with firearm manufacturers as she does it. Even before the latest massacre in Orlando, it was Jarrett who used her influence with President Barack Obama to resurrect the push for new regulations, gun control advocates say.  But since that shooting, she s employed a more aggressive strategy than did Vice President Joe Biden, whose consensus-building efforts failed to produce new laws three years ago. Take a recent White House bid to collaborate with weapons manufacturers on so-called  smart guns,  which make it impossible for anyone other than an authorized user to fire a weapon   and should be fertile ground for a relatively noncontroversial compromise. But after 30 industry executives refused to show up for a meeting last Friday, Jarrett decided to mobilize nearly 200,000 supporters behind a new assault weapons ban, which industry vehemently opposes and would take a best-seller off the shelves.  While it didn t slam the door on further negotiations, it s the kind of move that would make any future talks much more difficult. With Biden dispatched in search of a cure for cancer, and Obama demanding an end to the bloodshed, Jarrett   Obama's closest friend and conscience in the West Wing   is focused not only on measures like background checks, which are much easier to sell to Congress, at least compared with an assault weapons ban.  Jarrett is also executing Obama s call to  politicize  the issue during his last year in office and crank up the pressure on reluctant lawmakers.  Please keep making your voices heard.  Raise them over and over and over and over and over again,  Jarrett said on Monday in an unusual conference call, which was intended for the people who signed a  We the People  petition to ban the AR-15 but was broadcast live on YouTube for anyone to listen.  I ve had people say to me,  Well, I enjoy going to the firing range and using the assault weapons,   Jarrett said.   But the pleasure derived from that compared to the horrendous damage that it can do, we believe that the damage warrants banning assault weapons.  In the wake of the Orlando massacre, which involved a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, both Obama and Biden have made clear that, as Biden put it in his written response to the AR-15 petition, assault weapons  should be banned from civilian ownership.   But Biden focused his message to Congress on passing the background check and terror watch list bills that failed in the Senate on Monday. Jarrett went further:  There s no reason why Congress could not reauthorize legislation that would call for that ban.   And stoking support for the assault weapons ban with activists will likely intensify the political fight ahead of the 2016 elections. Previously, Obama put Biden in charge of crafting the administration s response to the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shootings, and the vice president still serves a prominent role as sympathizer-in-chief.  But since his effort ran aground, gun control advocates say, it s been Jarrett who s most effectively pushed for action over the past year despite congressional gridlock.  As the months went by and ideas were discussed and priorities came and went, she was a constant source of influence in the building making sure that the process was moving forward,  said Peter Ambler, director at Americans for Responsible Solutions.  When the group s co-founders, former Rep.  Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, proposed new executive actions during a January 2015 meeting with Obama and Jarrett in Phoenix, Ambler recalled, the president turned to his senior adviser to make them happen.  He announced new directives to expand background checks a year later.   I don t think that there is an individual at the White House except for the president who can claim more responsibility for the successes of the executive actions than Valerie Jarrett,  Ambler said. To be sure, top aides in the White House Counsel and Chief of Staff s office also played pivotal roles in developing the latest round of executive actions.  Biden is still playing a key part, too, though he's increasingly turned his attention to his  Cancer Moonshot.   People in the West Wing say his close relationship with police   forged in the mid-1990s during his work on the crime bill   has been especially valuable.  Just last month, for example, he opened a meeting with law enforcement officials that was supposed to be about criminal justice reform with a pointed pitch for smart guns.  And as the architect of the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban and original background check bill, he s got substantial credibility with activists, especially those driven by grief.   I refuse to give up, we refuse to give up,  Biden said on Wednesday at a Washington fundraiser for Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention group founded by parents of the first-graders gunned down at the elementary school.  It took me seven years to get the first ban put in place,  said Biden, who had argued that the administration should prioritize guns even before the Newtown shooting.   We should not stop.  But as the audience waited for Biden to come to the podium, Jarrett was in the back of the room, deep in conversation, as her top aides   Paulette Aniskoff, Bess Evans and Yohannes Abraham   circulated through the crowd.  It was those aides, in Jarrett s Office of Public Engagement, who have gradually taken on the bulk of the gun portfolio over the past three years, even as they continue to collaborate with Biden s staff. The portfolio has been something of an orphan in the Obama administration, with no obvious point person, particularly after the legislation Biden was working on failed in April 2013, and Bruce Reed, who had run an exhaustive series of outreach and strategy sessions with gun control advocates in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, stepped down as Biden s chief of staff in late 2013. Jarrett brought it back into the West Wing   and out to the statehouses, advocates said, by making it a priority for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.  In May, for example, Jarrett presided over a White House strategy session on enacting local laws to expand background checks and promote gun safety technology with elected officials from 48 states, featuring a peptalk keynote from Biden. In his search for progress after Newtown, Biden and his staff famously met with, as he put it,  every possible stakeholder in this debate; 229 separate groups,  in just a few months.  They settled on expanding background checks, a measure that s hovered above 80 percent public approval since 2013.  The bill failed in the Senate then, and an updated version failed on Monday, 56 to 44. Meeting with stakeholders is also a raison d etre of Jarrett s office.  Part of the Valerie Jarrett portfolio is working with the many constituencies that have a stake in the issues that matter most, and one of those has become the family members of victims of shootings,  said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who works on gun policy. Jarrett herself is in that category: She s recounted how her grandfather was killed with his own gun when burglars broke into his office. The administration still take pains to stress their support for the Second Amendment right for individual gun ownership.  During Jarrett s call, among the questions hand-picked by staff was asking why  you trying to disarm  citizens.   We wouldn t take a gun away from a law-abiding citizen,  Jarrett insisted.  We wouldn t take a gun away from anyone.  The National Rifle Association disputes that.  A spokeswoman for the gun rights group said that banning an entire class of firearms is, by definition, taking guns from law-abiding citizens. She was trying the approach of outreach to skeptics before a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, when her focus was on smart guns.  The administration is working to get buy-in from police for the technology, in hopes of creating a new market; earlier this month, the Department of Justice hosted law enforcement officials to talk about how smart guns might work for their departments. Manufacturers have expressed some openness to smart guns   they could be a whole new sales category, after all   but they fear any sort of government mandate, as well as backlash from gun rights groups. So weeks before the Orlando shooting, Jarrett and chief of staff Denis McDonough invited executives from about 30 gunmakers to the White House.  They declined, according to an industry executive, because they perceived the invitation as  disingenuous.    Jarrett lashed out at the gun lobby in her call.  The NRA over the past 7  years has never been willing to come to the table and work with us,  she said.  (Incidentally, both the industry and the NRA met with Biden and his staff in 2013, but there was no detente. )And there s some appetite for action on the Democratic side of the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton wants to take  weapons of war  off the streets. But despite Jarrett s call to resurrect a bill banning assault weapons, there s little appetite for it in Congress.  Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), who wrote the White House s preferred version in 2013, hasn t even decided to reintroduce it.  John McCain is running for reelection like it s 2010. The Arizona Republican has made his opposition to Obamacare   which dominated Senate races across the country six years ago   a central point of his campaign, by all accounts, the toughest reelection fight of his career.  He s betting that shrinking coverage options and premium increases that could go as high as 65 percent if insurers get their way will resonate with Arizona voters, even as most of his Republican colleagues running this year have moved on to other issues. The issue helps him run to the right of his GOP primary opponent, while also taking a direct shot at his Democratic opponent, Rep.  Ann Kirkpatrick, who called her 2010 vote for the law the one she s  most proud about.    I think it s a very strong issue,  McCain told POLITICO about his focus on Obamacare.   Eight of the counties in my state will now only have one [health insurer.  They re staring at 65 percent increases in their premiums.  They re very upset.  That s a different strategy than the one McCain s colleagues are employing.  GOP Sens.  Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson all won their seats in 2010 by promising to oppose President Barack Obama s recently passed health care law, but they ve hardly mentioned it in their reelection campaigns this year.  Instead, their TV spots have focused on national security, the economy and the opioid epidemic.  None of them, however, face a serious primary opponent and only Johnson is running against a Democrat who was in Congress in 2010. Brad Todd, a veteran Republican media consultant, sees the lack of Obamacare-focused ads as a missed opportunity.   I think it has been completely overlooked this cycle by too many campaigns,  he said.   It is less popular today than it ever was.  He s betting campaigns will start messaging on it eventually.   I really think you ll end up seeing it in every race,  Todd added. Putting the president s law front and center is a double-edged sword, though.  This year marks the first presidential cycle in which most of the law s benefits   insurance coverage that started in 2014   have been in effect.  There are millions of consumers who have gotten life-saving insurance coverage and worry about losing it under a GOP repeal plan.  But there s been no shortage of news stories about rising premiums and consumers who didn t realize how much they d have to pay for ACA plans.  And polls show that the law has not gotten more popular, as Democrats predicted it would once coverage rolled out.  Six years ago, many of the most vulnerable Republicans in this cycle rode into office by bashing the recently approved health care law.  And it worked   Republicans increased their numbers in the Senate and flipped control of the House.  Kirkpatrick was one of the House Democrats who lost her seat in the Republican wave. This cycle, McCain s Republican colleagues are focusing instead on the economy, or the worsening heroin and opioid addiction crises gripping their states.  New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been hit particularly hard by the epidemic. Portman of Ohio, for instance, has run four separate spots touting his efforts to fight heroin and opioid addiction in the state, including an emotional 60-second promotion.   He gives as much time and energy and love to this as any of us parents who have lost,  one Ohio parent, Tonda DaRe, says in the ad. McCain, however, may have more reason to focus on Obamacare than his Republican colleagues. In Arizona, two insurance companies   UnitedHealth and Humana   plan to leave the state s Obamacare exchange next year.  Blue Cross Blue Shield, which will be the only option for customers in eight counties, has asked state regulators to approve an average rate hike of 65 percent.  Most other insurers on the exchange have asked for double-digit rate increases, too.  Late last year, the state s co-op insurance plan went belly up, sending 60,000 customers looking for new coverage.  Obamacare is failing Arizonans,  the narrator says in McCain s first TV ad, which started airing last month.   First, a massive rate hike   more than twice the national average.  Then America s largest health insurer abandoned Arizona s failing Obamacare exchange.    Congresswoman Kirkpatrick bragged about her Obamacare vote,  the narrator continues, as the clip plays of Kirkpatrick calling the vote the one she s  most proud about.  The bad Obamacare headlines aren t unique to Arizona, but McCain has been most aggressive about using them.  The McCain folks have tapped into a serious concern in the marketplace.  They ve got real numbers   it s not theoretical, said Tom Miller, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  He s got a very tough race, a changing electorate, he has to deal with the Trump stuff   this allows him to say something a little more aggressive and be on the attack.  McCain has also taken other steps to shore up his anti-Obamacare bona fides.  In recent months, he s given several Senate floor speeches against it and issued statements responding to every piece of bad news on the law.  He s also tried to blunt likely attacks from Kirkpatrick supporters that Arizonians would lose their coverage if the law were repealed by introducing a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. Kirkpatrick s campaign says it isn t worried about McCain s Obamacare offensive.  While Kirkpatrick lost her seat in 2010 after voting for the ACA, she regained it in 2012 and held onto it in 2014   a year when many other Democrats in swing districts were swept away.  Outside groups and national Republicans have spent millions and millions against Ann over the years attacking her over her vote for Obamacare, D. B.  Mitchell, a Kirkpatrick spokesman, wrote in an email.   But Ann's continued to win a Republican district despite these attacks.  While the ads call out Kirkpatrick, they re also an effective attack against former state Sen.  Kelli Ward, an osteopath who s challenging McCain from the right in the primary.  In an interview, Ward said she commends McCain for attacking Kirkpatrick on the law   but she doesn t think he s the most reliable messenger.  It is a little disingenuous on Sen.  McCain s part,  Ward said.   He called the very senators who want to stop it  Sen.  Paul, Sen.  Cruz and Sen.  Lee    wacko birds.    McCain used the phrase for Paul, Cruz and Rep.  Justin Amash of Michigan in 2013 after Paul filibustered in an attempt to block confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director.  Paul, Cruz and Lee later led a failed effort to defund Obamacare that caused a partial government shutdown.  John McCain is running for reelection like it s 2010. The Arizona Republican has made his opposition to Obamacare   which dominated Senate races across the country six years ago   a central point of his campaign, by all accounts, the toughest reelection fight of his career.  He s betting that shrinking coverage options and premium increases that could go as high as 65 percent if insurers get their way will resonate with Arizona voters, even as most of his Republican colleagues running this year have moved on to other issues. The issue helps him run to the right of his GOP primary opponent, while also taking a direct shot at his Democratic opponent, Rep.  Ann Kirkpatrick, who called her 2010 vote for the law the one she s  most proud about.    I think it s a very strong issue,  McCain told POLITICO about his focus on Obamacare.   Eight of the counties in my state will now only have one [health insurer.  They re staring at 65 percent increases in their premiums.  They re very upset.  That s a different strategy than the one McCain s colleagues are employing.  GOP Sens.  Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson all won their seats in 2010 by promising to oppose President Barack Obama s recently passed health care law, but they ve hardly mentioned it in their reelection campaigns this year.  Instead, their TV spots have focused on national security, the economy and the opioid epidemic.  None of them, however, face a serious primary opponent and only Johnson is running against a Democrat who was in Congress in 2010. Brad Todd, a veteran Republican media consultant, sees the lack of Obamacare-focused ads as a missed opportunity.   I think it has been completely overlooked this cycle by too many campaigns,  he said.   It is less popular today than it ever was.  He s betting campaigns will start messaging on it eventually.   I really think you ll end up seeing it in every race,  Todd added. Putting the president s law front and center is a double-edged sword, though.  This year marks the first presidential cycle in which most of the law s benefits   insurance coverage that started in 2014   have been in effect.  There are millions of consumers who have gotten life-saving insurance coverage and worry about losing it under a GOP repeal plan.  But there s been no shortage of news stories about rising premiums and consumers who didn t realize how much they d have to pay for ACA plans.  And polls show that the law has not gotten more popular, as Democrats predicted it would once coverage rolled out.  Six years ago, many of the most vulnerable Republicans in this cycle rode into office by bashing the recently approved health care law.  And it worked   Republicans increased their numbers in the Senate and flipped control of the House.  Kirkpatrick was one of the House Democrats who lost her seat in the Republican wave. This cycle, McCain s Republican colleagues are focusing instead on the economy, or the worsening heroin and opioid addiction crises gripping their states.  New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been hit particularly hard by the epidemic. Portman of Ohio, for instance, has run four separate spots touting his efforts to fight heroin and opioid addiction in the state, including an emotional 60-second promotion.   He gives as much time and energy and love to this as any of us parents who have lost,  one Ohio parent, Tonda DaRe, says in the ad. McCain, however, may have more reason to focus on Obamacare than his Republican colleagues. In Arizona, two insurance companies   UnitedHealth and Humana   plan to leave the state s Obamacare exchange next year.  Blue Cross Blue Shield, which will be the only option for customers in eight counties, has asked state regulators to approve an average rate hike of 65 percent.  Most other insurers on the exchange have asked for double-digit rate increases, too.  Late last year, the state s co-op insurance plan went belly up, sending 60,000 customers looking for new coverage.  Obamacare is failing Arizonans,  the narrator says in McCain s first TV ad, which started airing last month.   First, a massive rate hike   more than twice the national average.  Then America s largest health insurer abandoned Arizona s failing Obamacare exchange.    Congresswoman Kirkpatrick bragged about her Obamacare vote,  the narrator continues, as the clip plays of Kirkpatrick calling the vote the one she s  most proud about.  The bad Obamacare headlines aren t unique to Arizona, but McCain has been most aggressive about using them.  The McCain folks have tapped into a serious concern in the marketplace.  They ve got real numbers   it s not theoretical, said Tom Miller, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  He s got a very tough race, a changing electorate, he has to deal with the Trump stuff   this allows him to say something a little more aggressive and be on the attack.  McCain has also taken other steps to shore up his anti-Obamacare bona fides.  In recent months, he s given several Senate floor speeches against it and issued statements responding to every piece of bad news on the law.  He s also tried to blunt likely attacks from Kirkpatrick supporters that Arizonians would lose their coverage if the law were repealed by introducing a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. Kirkpatrick s campaign says it isn t worried about McCain s Obamacare offensive.  While Kirkpatrick lost her seat in 2010 after voting for the ACA, she regained it in 2012 and held onto it in 2014   a year when many other Democrats in swing districts were swept away.

Paul, Cruz and Lee later led a failed effort to defund Obamacare that caused a partial government shutdown.                  Elizabeth Warren has been an outspoken surrogate for Hillary Clinton. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) will join Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail Monday in Cincinnati, the presumptive Democratic nominee's campaign announced Wednesday. At a public event in Cincinnati, Clinton and Warren will discuss their shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, the campaign said in its announcement. Warren has been an outspoken surrogate for Clinton, and is reported to be on the former secretary of state's shortlist for vice presidential candidates.  The liberal Massachusetts senator visited Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn last Friday, where she told staff, Don't screw this up.                  At the end of the first quarter Team Ryan had $3. 2 million on hand, and Ryan for Congress had $7. 6 million in the bank compared to Donald Trump's less than $1. 3 million on hand.   Donald Trump says he wants the Republican Party to start helping him fill up his barren campaign coffers. He shouldn t necessarily count on Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan (R-Wis. ) is crafting an election-year campaign schedule focused on maintaining majorities in the House and Senate   a weighty task, with control of Congress in the balance.  Any other request   raising money for Trump or helping him turn out the vote   will be considered on a case-by-case basis, an aide in Ryan s political operation said.  Speaker Ryan is focusing on supporting House and Senate Republicans,  the aide said.   The [Republican National Committee has not asked him to participate in any fundraisers to date but should they ask, we will give those requests due consideration.  It s significant, because Ryan has emerged as one of the most prolific fundraisers in the Republican Party.  Ryan s political operation   dubbed Team Ryan   raised $17 million in the first quarter of 2016.  He has raised more than $30 million for the Republican Party since October, and has transferred more than $21 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee this cycle. As of the end of the first quarter, Team Ryan had $3. 2 million on hand, and Ryan for Congress   the speaker s reelection account   had $7. 6 million in the bank. Trump, by comparison, has less than $1. 3 million on hand, according to a campaign filing made public Monday night.  In various interviews over the past few days, Trump has said he would like elected Republicans to step up their game when it comes to fundraising for the party's presumptive nominee.  If it gets to a point I'll do what I did in the primaries   I spent $55 million in the primaries,  Trump said on NBC s  Today Show  Tuesday.   I may do it again in the general election, but it would be nice to have some help from the party.  But Ryan, the top elected Republican in the country, seems solely focused on Congress.  With Congress out of session next week, the speaker is making stops in California and Texas next week for fundraising events.  Ryan isn't alone: Many top donors have shifted their focus and dollars to retaining GOP control of Congress, instead of the presidential election.  Ryan's posture is not altogether unfamiliar.  Former Speaker John Boehner mostly focused on reelecting House Republicans, but he did get-out-the-vote events for Mitt Romney.  Ryan, however, has a much bigger profile   and is far more popular   than Boehner.  In addition to working to reelect House Republicans, Ryan has also quietly helped out some of his friends in the Senate.  He did a mailing for Sen.  Pat Toomey (R-Pa. ), with whom Ryan lived during his early days in Congress.  And he appeared in Burlington, Wisconsin, for Sen.  Ron Johnson s (R-Wis. ) reelection kickoff event.  There are many competitive Senate races in states that also have competitive House seats   such as Illinois, Nevada and Pennsylvania   giving Ryan the opportunity to double up on events.  Ryan s political team is  considering doing further events in the coming months for many of our incumbent senators with tough races once the legislative calendar slows down, an aide said.                   It s not about Harriet Tubman, it s about keeping the picture on the $20, Steve King said, pulling out a $20 bill  and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.   The House will not vote to block the inclusion of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, dodging a politically charged vote for GOP lawmakers. Rep.  Steve King (R-Iowa) had filed an amendment to a bill funding the Treasury Department to prohibit the department from redesigning any currency to showcase the abolitionist icon, but the Rules Committee denied floor consideration of the proposal Tuesday night. It's not about Harriet Tubman, it's about keeping the picture on the $20, King said Tuesday evening, pulling a $20 bill from his pocket and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.  Y'know? Why would you want to change that? I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have. The conservative gadfly said it is racist and sexist to say a woman or person of color should be added to currency.  Here's what's really happening: This is liberal activism on the part of the president that's trying to identify people by categories, and he's divided us on the lines of groups.  . . .  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine's unifying.  It says just don't change anything. The Treasury Department announced in April that it would move the image of Jackson to the back of the $20 note, replacing him with Tubman, a former slave who helped other slaves escape to freedom and served with the Union Army during the Civil War.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also announced plans to redesign $5 and $10 bills to include leaders from the women's rights and civil rights movements.  Neither Abraham Lincoln nor Alexander Hamilton would be removed from their spots on the front of the $5 and $10 notes. King is not alone among Republicans opposed to placing the abolitionist and civil rights icon on the $20 bill.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in April that the move was pure political correctness and recommended that an image of Tubman be placed on the $2 bill. Amendments to appropriations bills have proven troublesome to Republicans in recent weeks.  After a Democratic amendment to prohibit discrimination by federal contractors against LGBT people was added to a bill funding energy and water programs, Republicans dropped their support for the measure, and it was defeated.  That kerfuffle led Speaker Paul Ryan to go back on his commitment to allow for an open amendment process and instead limit which amendments could be considered. The Rules Committee blocked consideration of the LGBT amendment, as it has in recent weeks.  The willingness of the GOP-controlled panel to stymie a fellow Republican, particularly amid conservative frustration with a limited amendment process, demonstrates the desire to avoid controversial votes in an election year. King, for his part, saw the amendment as crucial. President Obama's on his way out the door, he said.  He's going to do everything he can think of to upset this society and this civilization.

They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race, said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank, said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was almost so low that it's not even comprehendable.  After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading THE FIRST ONE.  Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort, said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.  By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.  I was very involved in Mitt Romney's fundraising effort in 2008, and immediately after he got out of the primary he got his team together and he said we all need to get behind John McCain, and I ended up raising more money that year for John McCain than I did for Mitt Romney by the time the election ended, Tanenblatt said.  There wasn't that effort with regard to the Trump campaign because the Trump campaign didn't raise money on their own and didn't reach out to supporters of the other candidates like donors are accustomed.  Typically, the nominee is the one who is magnanimous and reaches out to the supporters of the other campaigns and unifies and works to unify the party.  I don't think that happened to the extent it should have. Defending his campaign's financial situation on Tuesday, Trump pointed out that he could simply reach into his own wallet if needs be. There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars, Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign.  Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Still, those who worked for Trump's vanquished rivals, while fretting that Clinton s war chest so dramatically eclipses Trump's, were unable to resist the temptation to knock the real estate mogul's funding strategy.  I thought he was self funding? ;), a chief strategist for one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump early in the GOP primary wrote in an email.  Several Republicans argued that it's unlikely that the GOP donor class will make a mad rush to close the money gap between Clinton and Trump, since there's still a strong distaste for Trump among some donors.  Those feelings go both ways: One Republican donor who recently met with then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recalled him suggesting that Trump strongly disliked asking major GOP donors for money. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the donors that have been loyal Republican supporters over the past few election cycles have been vilified by Trump, and he said that he could win without them and was going to self-fund, so they're not inspired to jump on board with significant donations, said Spies.  What would possibly move them to support him would be across-the-board enthusiasm about the nominee or a bandwagon effect.  I mean, if all your friends are giving, you don't want to be left out, but this number is an indication that none of your friends are giving, so why would you be the guy out front supporting Trump when nobody else is?A former bundler for Jeb Bush was even more direct about his disinterest in helping Trump.  This is a guy who lent himself $30 [million or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back.  This is a total fraud.  He's a fraud, the former Bush bundler said, referring to the fact that Trump loaned his campaign the cash and could still repay himself.  There's a universe of, I don't know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who's not going to [contribute.  So that's part of it.  And I think we're just not going to stick our necks out for that.  This isn't a situation like Ben Carson, where he's blowing through money like nobody's business.  I don't think that s blowing through tons of money.  They didn't have a huge staff to begin with.  They're not fully staffed to run a national campaign. The question now, Tanenblatt said, is what Trump does going forward in terms of picking a vice-presidential candidate and what he says in public.  That could determine whether his fundraising picks up or not.  I think that says a lot about him as a candidate,  Tanenblatt said.   That's probably the biggest decision that he's going to make in the campaign, so that will send a signal.  David Tamasi, a former fundraiser for New Jersey Gov.  Chris Christie's presidential campaign, stressed that it's still a long way until Election Day, and he said Republicans shouldn t read too much into May fundraising numbers.  It's easy to look at May and compare that to somebody who's had a 25-year start to make some sort of comparison, none of which are flattering, but I think it's an inaccurate portrayal of where things will be once things get hot, Tamasi said.  They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.

Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a world-class liar who may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her pathetic email and server statements, Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me, Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's rigged against the American people. In contrast, Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft, Trump said. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash, Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001, Trump said.  They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. Clinton does not have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office, Trump said. Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people, Trump sid to applause.  She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Trump used details from Clinton Cash, the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  (The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as false, right-wing attacks funded by the Koch brothers. )Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server, Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger, Trump continued.  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. He continued, National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, Trump said.  She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. Trump also alleged that Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State  threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, [yeah, I guess so and I wish the first time it was done correctly when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya, Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it, he said.   This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  Vowing to build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth and ensure the military will have the best technology and finest equipment, Trump promised massive new factories that will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know, he said.  I say, nobody knows it better.                  Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas on June 18.   Donald Trump launched a new allegation at Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, accusing her of having laundered money through a for-profit university while she was secretary of state. In a rapid-response email blast sent during Clinton s speech attacking Trump s economic proposals, the billionaire s campaign accused the former secretary of state of funneling government money to Laureate Education, a for-profit chain of universities that employed Bill Clinton as honorary chancellor until April 2015. The former president made $16. 5 million over his five years in that position while his wife added Laureate to the State Department Global Partnership.  Trump alleges the Department of State awarded $55. 2 million in grants to Laureate, an accusation that is not quite accurate since there is no indication that State Department money flowed directly to the for-profit education chain.  According to Bloomberg, the $55. 2 million in State Department and USAID grant money actually went to the International Youth Foundation, a non-profit group headed by Laurate Education Chairman Douglas Becker. That same Bloomberg investigation showed that the IYF received $9 million in State Department grants in 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate.  The number jumped to $15. 1 million in 2010, Bill Clinton's first year with Laureate, and ballooned to $25. 5 million in grants in 2012.  This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle,  Trump s email read.   Laureate made money by racking up student debt on vulnerable students.  Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by pointing to IYF's history of working with the State Department and USAID that dates back to the George W.  Bush administration. This is yet another false allegation from Donald Trump, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.  The International Youth Foundation was funded by the Bush administration, well before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.  In fact, the non-profit's USAID funding actually went down in the year that she arrived at the State Department, not up. International Youth Foundation CEO and President Bill Reese dismissed as  totally erroneous  and  ridiculous  the suggestion by Trump or anybody else that the foundation had been the beneficiary of political quid-pro-quo.  He said all of the foundation s grants have been won competitively and that the non-profit goes through rigorous, government-mandated audit processes that would have caught any money being steered from IYF back to Laureate.  If there was government money going back to a private company, let alone a board member s company, my God it would all have to be reported,  Reese said.   Or we d be in violation of OMB regulations, of IRS regulations, of normal auditing practice by non-profits.  It s just, it s crazy.  Reese said the uptick in government money beginning in 2010 came from grants awarded during both the Obama and Bush administrations that paid out over the course of several years and had no correlation to Bill Clinton s position with Laureate. Reese also conceded that Becker does sit on the IYF s board of directors but said the Laureate chairman is just one of many high-profile board members, including the CEO and President of Hilton Worldwide and a former Senior Vice President of Saudi Arabia s national oil and gas company, Saudi Aramco.   It would be laughable,  Reese said of Trump s accusation.   But it s no laughing matter to be accused of things that of course have no factual basis.  While Trump s specific allegation of money laundering is new, accusations of an improper relationship between the Clintons, State Department, and Laureate are not.  The connections between the three were originally published in the 2015 book  Clinton Cash  by Peter Schweizer and reported on by Bloomberg and Inside Higher Education.  At the time, Laureate denied the accusations, and said that IYF was an independent non-profit organization; not an affiliate of Laureate. Trump contrasted Clinton s troubled ties to Laureate Education with his own Trump University, where the email said the candidate  has created an incredible learning experience for students.   Like Trump University, Laureate was the subject of a class-action fraud lawsuit, although that case was later dismissed.                  Mark Cuban said Donald Trump has been getting stupider as the campaign progresses.   Mark Cuban stepped up his criticism of Donald Trump s campaign on Tuesday, this time attacking him personally.  You know what? It s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, but he s really working at it  You have to give him credit.  It s a difficult thing to do but he s accomplished it,  the billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner said in an interview with Extra.  Earlier on Tuesday, Cuban tweeted saying Trump  doesn t have the cash  to fund his own campaign, following a Federal Election Commission report showing his campaign had $1. 3 million compared to Hillary Clinton s $42 million at the beginning of June. Cuban also told Extra on the set of ABC's Shark Tank that the presumptive nominee had to  start learning and understanding the issues.    Donald has been at this a year but you don t look at him and say,  Wow, he s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic. ' In fact, you look at him and say,  What the hell are you talking about?',  he added. Trump, he remarked, would get kicked out of 'Shark Tank' so fast, it would make your head spin.                   A jury found Chaka Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering and bank fraud, among other charges.   Top House Democrats are wrestling over whether they should demand the resignation   or seek his expulsion from Congress   of Rep.  Chaka Fattah, the longtime Pennsylvania Democrat convicted Tuesday on an array of federal corruption charges. On Tuesday, a federal jury found Fattah guilty of bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and making false statements about a criminal scheme that began with Fattah's unsuccessful attempt to become mayor of Philadelphia. In the past, lawmakers found guilty of similar criminal acts resigned or were expelled by their colleagues if they didn't voluntarily leave office.  The same could happen to Fattah, although the abbreviated congressional calendar due to an election year makes it more difficult to move quickly against the veteran Democrat. In a statement released by his office, Fattah gave no sign that he was ready to step down, which would shift the burden to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and other senior Democrats to take action.  This is an extraordinarily difficult day for me and my family.  A jury has decided that based on the evidence presented to them that I am guilty of charges presented by the government, Fattah said.  Today s decision notwithstanding, it has been my privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional District for over 20 years. Fattah added: While today s outcome isn t what we had hoped, I respect our nation s judicial system.  I want to thank the people of the Second Congressional District for the honor of serving them.  Fattah, who was indicted by the Justice Department last year, had already lost the Democratic primary to state Rep.  Dwight Evans.  He is scheduled to be sentenced in October, although an appeal of his conviction is widely anticipated. Pelosi's office had no comment.  A senior Democratic aide said the Ethics Committee would have responsiblity for taking any action on Fattah. Under House rules, lawmakers convicted of crimes that carry sentences of more than two years cannot vote in committee or on the floor.  That makes Fattah unable to fully participate in Congress: Bribery charges alone carry up to 20 years behind bars. But Fattah has not resigned his seat, and if he does not do so, his colleagues may be forced to expel him. Already some Republicans are publicly suggesting that if Fattah won't voluntarily leave, he should be forced out of office.  He should resign   he s been convicted,  said Rep.  Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio.   The House needs to look out for its own ethics and image.  Stivers later added:  If he won t resign, I think the House should take action  to expel him. For Democrats, it s not so easy.  Missouri Democratic Rep.  Emanuel Cleaver, a fellow Congressional Black Caucus member, said he s giving his colleague and former fraternity brother some space   at least for now. [Fattah needs time to think it over and pray about it and sit down with his family and hopefully some clergy friends and make decisions based on logic more than politics,  Cleaver said.   I m sure he is going through a lot of emotions right now.  We ought to give him time to figure out what his best next steps should be for his future and family.  Cleaver said he believed Fattah will appeal the conviction.  Asked if he should focus on that appeal rather than serving in Congress, Cleaver said,  That s what I would think  He s been convicted of seven counts.  It s devastating.  People are saying it could be 20 years. . . . Another senior black Democrat who did not wish to go on record said he thought Fattah should resign.  Democrats, after all, don t want a convicted felon in their ranks.  But they also don t want to look like they re forcing out one of their own out of office, especially if Fattah appeals. With Tuesday a travel day for lawmakers   including Pelosi   Democratic leaders were scrambling to figure out a response to Fattah's conviction.  Pelosi did not comment on the conviction, and other Democrats were reluctant to discuss it during the evening votes. Action to expel Fattah would have to be initiated by the House Ethics Committee before coming to the full House floor for a vote.  That s what happened in 2002 to the late Democratic Rep.  Jim Traficant of Ohio, who was also was convicted of federal corruption charges. If expulsion proceedings are initiated against Fattah   which would only happen if the Justice Department assured the Ethics Committee such a move would not interfere with the criminal proceedings   the trial transcript would be the key piece of evidence against him. Fattah would then be given a chance to testify on his own behalf and present evidence to defend himself, as Traficant did in 2002. House insiders suggested the Ethics Committee has not interacted with DOJ yet over the Fattah matter.  In August 2015, Ethics convened an investigative subcommittee to look into the allegations against Fattah but deferred action due to DOJ's ongoing criminal probe. House Ethics Committee Chairman Charlie Dent (R), who is also from Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the Fattah case.

Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn and Xavier Becerra take questions during a news conference at the Capitol on May 11.   House Democrats are trying to force a vote on several gun control measures, but are being shut down by the GOP majority. For the second time in two weeks, Rep.  James Clyburn (S. C. ) sought to be recognized on the House floor Tuesday night so he could bring up two gun-related bills on expanded background checks and the so-called No fly, no buy proposal.  That measure states that anyone on the FBI's No Fly list cannot purchase a gun. But Republicans refused to allow Clyburn to move forward.  Democrats began yelling No bill, no break!   meaning they want to cancel the July congressional recess   although their outburst ended after a couple minutes. The episode shows how little power the minority has in the House of Representatives, but also points to the fact that Clyburn, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif. ) and other Democrats aren't dropping the issue any time soon. With the nation still stunned by the bloody June 12 shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead and another 53 wounded   the worst mass shooting in U. S.  history   Democrats on Capitol Hill have responded by forcing   or in the case of House Democrats, attempting to do so   votes on several gun-related bills they say have broad support with the American public. Senate Democrats, led by Sens.  Chris Murphy (Conn. ) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif. ), failed to get the support they needed to move forward on the proposals in a Monday night showdown, although more gun votes will take place in that chamber later this week. House Democrats, for their part, have no such leverage to force votes, except by putting enough political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) and other Republicans to goad them into taking action.  Clyburn, Pelosi and other Democrats hope the theatrics on the House floor   a respected senior Democratic lawmaker seeking recognition only to be ignored by Republicans   highlights GOP intransigence on the issue. Pelosi has been strongly pushing the No fly, no buy provision, pointing to the fact that it has broad public support in polls.  The California Democrat is now employing a No bill, no break line to urge Ryan to postpone the July 15 recess unless the House passes the No fly, no buy bill. Every day, there is going to be more and more pressure on Ryan to give us a vote, or send us home without a vote, said Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ), who is in charge of messaging for House Democrats.  So far, they're dug in, so we're going to use every strategy and tactic we have to either punish them from being dug in or help them pick their feet off the ground. While some progressive Democrats want their leadership to advocate a vote on assault weapons ban, Pelosi and other top Democrats argue that there is not sufficient backing to do that at this time.                  GOP leaders are holding out hope that the Corey Lewandowski firing will led Donald Trump to run a more professional campaign.    The ouster of Donald Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday brought back a familiar refrain on Capitol Hill: Maybe now the presumptive GOP nominee s campaign will finally change. To the endless frustration of GOP senators, Trump's campaign that has repeatedly shrugged off their advice to tone down the rhetoric, focus on policy and lay off tough talk aimed at federal judges and minority groups.  Lewandowski was seen as a lead proponent of the campaigning style that helped Trump win over millions of primary voters but antagonized many Republicans in Congress.  Now that he s gone, GOP leaders are holding out hope that Trump will stop the divisiveness and start to run a more professional campaign.   It s probably a recognition that they re going to   turn the page, so to speak, in terms of their strategy,  said Sen.  John Thune of South Dakota, the No.  3 Senate Republican.   They re trying to demonstrate that they sort of get it.  And that they re going to have to start moving in a different direction.   In interviews with more than a half-dozen senators Monday, the mood was slightly more upbeat than last week, when Trump was again pushing a proposal to block Muslims from entering the country, on the heels of attacking a federal judge over his ethnicity. The power vacuum left by Lewandowski will be filled by senior advisor Paul Manafort, who is far more familiar to Capitol Hill denizens.   We know him pretty well.  He s a steady dependable fellow who will bring the histrionics down to a more acceptable level,  said Sen.  Orrin Hatch of Utah. Yet several Republican lawmakers said they aren t holding their breath.  Ultimately, the skeptics said, it's on the candidate to change his behavior.  There were strong signals that Republicans feel like they ve been jilted too many times by promises of Trump pivots that never materialized. It was barely a month ago that Trump visited Capitol Hill and won plaudits from a wide array of Republicans anxious to rally behind a standard bearer for the general election.   Not really sure what it means,  said Sen.  Thom Tillis of North Carolina.   Really don t know what motivated him   This is clearly a campaign nobody can predict.  Trump told Fox News  Bill O Reilly on Monday night that the dismissal of Lewandowski means the campaign will go a  little bit of a different route  now.  That s what Republicans have been clamoring for for months.  All of us have been disappointed with some of the comments and think he s got to refocus,  said Sen.  Mike Rounds of South Dakota.   He got into personal things and now he s taking a second look at that hopefully.  A lot of us want to be his supporters and not his defenders.  And there s a difference. Others said it's too soon to know what the Lewandowski firing portends.  Granted anonymity to candidly assess the state of GOP relations with Trump, one top Republican aide said that it s hard to see Manafort all of a sudden producing a more scripted candidate who doesn t make GOP senators squirm on a daily basis:  The candidate s the problem.  I don t think anybody can curtail [Trump   I haven t seen any evidence of it.  While some senators were bullish about a turnaround, even campaign shake-up this big wasn t enough to get others to budge.  Several senators insisted they were unaware of the Lewandowski story, which broke many hours earlier and shook the political world.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who swore last week he was done talking about Trump until after the election, stood by his vow on Monday when asked about the firing. Trump s small group of Capitol Hill cheerleaders, on the other hand, said the campaign is on the rebound.  Manafort's background is more suited for this stage of the campaign.  It just is,  said Sen.  Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who called himself a  big fan of Corey.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.                   Irish prime minister Enda Kenny recently called Trump s views 'racist and dangerous. ' But then he quickly clarified that he would be willing to meet with the American businessman.   DUBLIN, Ireland   Want to make an Irish government official smile? Ask about Vice President Joe Biden s arrival in the Emerald Isle tomorrow.  Want to make them squirm? Ask them about the possibility that Donald Trump may crash the party.  The presumptive GOP presidential nominee tweeted last month that he would visit a Trump golf course in Ireland June 24 on top of a visit to his country club in Scotland   all, incidentally, as citizens of the United Kingdom vote in the landmark Brexit referendum on whether the U. K.  should remain in the European Union.  The trip isn t on the schedule that Trump s team gave to reporters last week.  But if he does show up, some Trump critics in the Emerald Isle are planning protests against over his views on Muslims, immigrants and more, however.   If he comes, we ll be out there protesting,  Eamon Ryan, a former energy minister who s now the head of the Irish Green Party, told POLITICO  In a globalized world, if he gets in, that does damage to us.  The Brexit referendum adds an odd backdrop: the campaign has been dominated by its own debates over immigration, diversity and tolerance and has regularly drawn comparisons to the U. S.  presidential race. And by a quirk of timing, Democrats will have an on-the-ground rapid-response team ready: Biden, who will be making his first extended visit to the old sod from June 21-25.  Irish politicians are clamoring for an audience with Biden.  The vice president, for whom Irish jokes are a go-to applause line, arrived in Ireland Tuesday and will look into his family roots before capping the week with a speech about the  values of tolerance, diversity and inclusiveness  in Dublin, according to his office. In contrast, Irish government officials have been awkwardly discussing how to deal with a potential visit by a Trump, a divisive figure who's nevertheless a potential head of state   and an investor in Ireland   officials told POLITICO. Trump was feted by the Irish government two years ago when he bought the course.  But things have obviously changed a bit in the last two years.  Irish prime minister Enda Kenny recently called Trump s views  racist and dangerous.   But then he quickly clarified that he would be willing to meet with the American businessman   a reflection of Ireland s reputation as a business-friendly country. Irish officials reacted awkwardly when the topic of Trump same up.   I ve always been an Obama man, and Trump is no Obama,  offered Eoghan Murphy, the Irish minister of state in charge of financial services, in an interview with POLITICO. Ryan, the Green Party leader, says he intends to organize protests in the town of Ennis, near the gold course, and on O Connell Street in Dublin.  The road is named after Daniel O Connell   an Irish nationalist leader who was friends with American abolitionist and civil rights leader Frederick Douglas and was devoted to  American constitutional values,  Ryan says.   That s not Trump.    President Barack Obama endorsed LinkedIn as a job search tool Monday, joking that he would use the professional social media network to seek employment after he leaves the White House. America is  an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama said, after ticking through a list of facts that support that statement. As he frequently does when speaking to younger people, Obama made the case that if given the choice to live in any era   not knowing what your gender, ethnicity or class would be    you would choose right now.   You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history,  he said in his keynote address at the Washington Hilton for the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit.   Less violent.  Less driven by division.  You d choose today.  Obama touted the country s steady rate of private sector job growth, high school graduation rate, percentage of Americans insured under Obamacare, slow growth of health care costs and  high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field.   Our rule of law, our mature capital markets   all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama added.   Now that s a pretty good sales pitch.  I don t mind being America s pitchman, and in seven months or so   in seven months or so, I ll be on the job market, and I m glad I m gonna be here.  I m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.  In February, the president posted on LinkedIn about his first summer job scooping ice cream to announce a summer job initiative for young people.  My first summer job wasn t exactly glamorous, but it taught me some valuable lessons.  Responsibility.  Hard work.  Balancing a job with friends, family, and school,  Obama wrote.   We re kicking off a Summer Opportunity Project that brings together state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses   including LinkedIn   to get young people into their first jobs and create strong transitions between school years and from high school to college and careers.   Corey Lewandowski had fought his way back from the brink of termination at least twice over the past few months, utilizing a no-holds-barred style of infighting seldom seen in presidential politics while relying on the loyalty of a small group of allies and an unusually close relationship with his boss.  But Lewandowski s survival strategy began to backfire this month.  And by the time he was called into one of the executive offices at Donald Trump s campaign headquarters in Manhattan s Trump Tower on Monday morning for the final time as campaign manager, the once-obscure GOP operative had run out of lifelines.  He d grown increasingly reckless in his power struggle, taking on the candidate s own family and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  He d already told associates more than once in the past few months that he was on the verge of quitting, and some of his allies had either backed away from him or quit the campaign.  So when Lewandowski was informed in a meeting with Trump s adult children that he was being relieved of his dream job running the first-time candidate s presidential campaign, the career GOP operative didn t argue.  Lewandowski emerged from the executive office to find security waiting, and they watched him as he packed up his things, then escorted him out of the building, according to two sources briefed on the encounter.   He didn t put up a fight because he is loyal,  said one Lewandowski associate.   The gloves had come off a while ago, and Corey spent a lot of energy fighting, which took away from the campaign.   The source said Lewandowski  was surrounded by enemies.  He was outgunned.   Lewandowski declined to comment for this story.  He told CNN he was  proud to have been a small part  of Trump s campaign but didn t know why he was fired.   Things change as the campaign evolves,  he said, denying his dismissal had anything to do with tensions with Trump s family.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump stood by the decision.  He praised Lewandowski as  a good guy  and  a friend of mine  who  did a great job,  but he said  it s time now for a different kind of a campaign.  The Trump campaign would not say whether Trump was in the room for the firing.  It denied that Lewandowski s relationship with the candidate s family had anything to do with his termination, though the family members with whom sources say he clashed most   Trump s influential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner   did not respond to requests for comment.  The RNC also didn t respond to requests for comment. But interviews with about two dozen sources, including Trump family friends and people who work in and around the campaign, traced Lewandowski s firing to longstanding issues brought to the fore this month, as Trump struggled to pivot to a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton amid increasing campaign dysfunction and declining poll numbers.  The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, led to intensifying calls from influential Republicans   including Priebus   for Trump to moderate his inflammatory rhetoric, according to campaign sources.  They said that Lewandowski s critics   chief among them campaign chairman Paul Manafort   responded by arguing that Lewandowski was actually encouraging Trump s propensity to offend.  Priebus also told campaign officials that Lewandowski had become a significant impediment to ironing out tensions between the RNC and the campaign, according to two sources familiar with the interaction.  One said Priebus ticked off a number of areas in which Lewandowski  had been a roadblock.   The source said that Priebus' criticism  undercut and hurt the campaign,  which is more reliant on the national party for basic campaign infrastructure than that of any recent nominee. And Lewandowski s critics also pinned the blame on him for unflattering media coverage of Kushner s growing behind-the-scenes role in the campaign, according to three sources familiar with internal campaign dynamics.  This month, for instance, The Associated Press profiled Kushner, citing people inside the campaign griping about his inexperience and noting his father s convictions for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness intimidation. The perception inside Trump s inner circle was that  Corey was trying to isolate Trump and cut him off from even Ivanka and Jared,  said a longtime Trump business associate who speaks to the family and its representatives regularly.   That was overstepping his bounds.  Ivanka Trump, who for months had expressed misgivings about Lewandowski s temperament and qualifications for the job, last week grew increasingly resolute in her calls for his termination, according to several people in and around the campaign and the family.  One person close to the campaign said it got  to the point where she was going to distance herself from the campaign if Corey didn t go.  By early last week, erstwhile Trump adviser Roger Stone, a Manafort ally who had pushed for months for Lewandowski s ouster, was gleefully telling associates that a coup was imminent. In some ways, Lewandowski s story is the story of the Trump campaign. The scrappy 42-year-old from the hardscrabble mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, didn t have any presidential campaign experience when he was plucked from relative obscurity to run Trump s presidential campaign prior to its June 2015 launch.  At the time, the billionaire real estate showman was regarded by the political establishment as a sideshow with little chance of making an impact in the race, let alone winning the nomination. Lewandowski quickly built a strong rapport with Trump by treating him with absolute reverence, unfailingly referring to him as  Mr.  Trump  or  Sir    even when Trump wasn t around   and encouraging him to act on his bombastic instincts.  Lewandowski also reassured the sometimes tightfisted billionaire, who initially pledged to self-fund his campaign, that it wasn t necessary to invest serious money in the traditional tools of presidential campaigning, such as polling, voter files, analytics and major advertising campaigns.  Instead, Lewandowski s approach was to hire a tiny staff composed mostly of allies from his past jobs and to  let Trump be Trump.   The result was impressive: billions of dollars  worth of free publicity generated by Trump s confrontational rhetoric at splashy campaign rallies, during television interviews and on social media.  Initially, Trump s adult children were wary of Lewandowski s unwillingness to try to temper their father s rhetoric because they were concerned that it was damaging the family s brand and corporate partnerships, said the longtime Trump business associate.  But as Trump gained traction in the polls and began winning primaries, the Trump children realized that their father actually had a chance to win and questioned whether Lewandowski was  helping take their father to the next level, because he is not getting the type of advice he needs to temper his worst impulses,  said the associate.  But Trump stuck by Lewandowski, even after he was accused of roughing up a reporter in March, rejecting calls to fire him by explaining I don't do that.  I'm loyal. By the end of the month, though, Trump had brought on Manafort, a veteran of 40 years' worth of GOP presidential campaigns.  The move, which multiple sources said came at the behest of Trump s adult children, seemed a tacit acknowledgment of the limitations of Lewandowski s approach. Manafort brought in a cadre of associates from his days as a power lobbyist, dividing the campaign into two rival camps loyal to Manafort and Lewandowski.  The camps dispensed sometimes contradictory orders to campaign staff and provided conflicting advice to Trump.  Manafort urged more spending on advertising and hiring, while Lewandowski pushed back, vetoing at least two proposed Manafort hires. In an April meeting at Trump Tower, Trump deputized Manafort to reorganize the campaign and to take the reins, as first reported by POLITICO.  A top Lewandowski ally on the campaign named Stuart Jolly immediately tendered his resignation.  Lewandowski went home to his family in New Hampshire and privately told associates he intended to quit imminently as well, but Trump personally asked him to return, according to two campaign sources.  When he reappeared at Trump Tower, the infighting intensified to a degree unusual even in the alpha-dominated world of presidential politics, according to a handful of campaign insiders.  They describe a campaign in which the senior officials and their allies spent as much or more time waging internecine warfare as they did on campaign strategy. Manafort s allies circulated rumors about Lewandowski s personal life and had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a New York tabloid, according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to be.  Lewandowski s supporters, in turn, have urged Trump and his representatives to examine Manafort s personal life as well as the lobbying done by Manafort and his associates for controversial clients around the world, according to people on both sides of the Lewandowski-Manafort rift.  And according to two campaign sources, Lewandowski highlighted for Trump instances in which Manafort had been quoted telling ostensibly private audiences that the candidate intended to tone down his rhetoric in the general election.  Those reports deeply bothered Trump, who prided himself on rejecting political norms dictating that candidates speak from a script and avoid making provocative remarks. Manafort didn't respond to a request for comment. Late last month, Lewandowski successfully pushed Trump to fire one of Manafort s first major hires, political director Rick Wiley.  And he jealously guarded his access to the candidate, making sure that either he or an ally   usually communications director Hope Hicks   were at Trump s side at all times.  On plane rides, Lewandowski and Hicks would trade off Trump-watch duties, taking turns sitting next to him when one or the other needed to go to the bathroom, according to a source who witnessed the arrangement. But in recent days, Trump has increasingly seemed to come to grips with the need to expand his campaign and tone down his rhetoric, telling donors at a private fundraiser in Arizona on Saturday that he was preparing to pivot to the general election, according to a donor who was present.  Lewandowski accompanied Trump to the fundraiser, at the Goldwater House, where he was seen pacing back and forth with anxious energy, which is not at all unusual for the Red Bull-chugging operative.  In fact, the decision seems to have surprised Lewandowski and his allies in and around the campaign. One campaign official said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss.  It was  a good chat,  the official said. Eli Stokols contributed to this report.  Corey Lewandowski had fought his way back from the brink of termination at least twice over the past few months, utilizing a no-holds-barred style of infighting seldom seen in presidential politics while relying on the loyalty of a small group of allies and an unusually close relationship with his boss.  But Lewandowski s survival strategy began to backfire this month.  And by the time he was called into one of the executive offices at Donald Trump s campaign headquarters in Manhattan s Trump Tower on Monday morning for the final time as campaign manager, the once-obscure GOP operative had run out of lifelines.  He d grown increasingly reckless in his power struggle, taking on the candidate s own family and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  He d already told associates more than once in the past few months that he was on the verge of quitting, and some of his allies had either backed away from him or quit the campaign.  So when Lewandowski was informed in a meeting with Trump s adult children that he was being relieved of his dream job running the first-time candidate s presidential campaign, the career GOP operative didn t argue.  Lewandowski emerged from the executive office to find security waiting, and they watched him as he packed up his things, then escorted him out of the building, according to two sources briefed on the encounter.   He didn t put up a fight because he is loyal,  said one Lewandowski associate.   The gloves had come off a while ago, and Corey spent a lot of energy fighting, which took away from the campaign.   The source said Lewandowski  was surrounded by enemies.  He was outgunned.   Lewandowski declined to comment for this story.  He told CNN he was  proud to have been a small part  of Trump s campaign but didn t know why he was fired.   Things change as the campaign evolves,  he said, denying his dismissal had anything to do with tensions with Trump s family.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump stood by the decision.

One campaign official said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss.  It was  a good chat,  the official said. Eli Stokols contributed to this report.  As Hillary Clinton spoke Tuesday, Donald Trump s campaign blasted out nine rapid-response emails to counter the Democrat s narrative that he would be disastrous for the country s economy.  Trump trashed Clinton on Twitter as well but didn't use his  Crooked Hillary  nickname. However cosmetic, the changes were noteworthy just one day after the firing of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who everyone from campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump s adult children believed had impeded efforts to professionalize Trump s unconventional operation.  The rapid response emails, which included myriad statistics about the country s slow economic recovery under the Obama administration, are one indication that the campaign heard criticism about its slow response to Clinton s last speech.  They re also an indication that Manafort intends to make Trump s campaign more disciplined and professional.  And Trump family confidant Michael Cohen, a top executive in Trump s corporation, said the candidate s three adult children   who, along with son-in-law Jared Kushner, were all involved in Lewandowski s firing   would be taking on greater roles both inside the operation and as surrogates for the candidate himself.  They re all incredibly bright, well-spoken and articulate advocates for their father, especially in dispelling some of the false reporting against Mr.  Trump by the liberal mainstream media,  Cohen said. But many Republicans, both supporters and skeptics of Trump s campaign, note that the consolidation of power by Manafort and the children does not guarantee any change in the candidate himself, whose undisciplined past few weeks   from his racially tinged criticism of a federal judge to his off-key, self-congratulatory response to the Orlando terrorist attack   have discouraged donors and leery Republicans who d still been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. In a news release Tuesday night, Trump's campaign confirmed that it has beefed up its communications staff while formally announcing several hires, including a national political director and a director of surrogates, made in recent weeks.  But the campaign also rolled out a new website using the very phrase he avoided in his tweets, lyingcrookedhillary. com.  The site isn't live yet. On Wednesday, Trump is set to give a speech that will seek to outline his argument against Clinton, who made her first, focused speech criticizing him nearly a month ago.  Seven weeks after securing the GOP nomination, Trump has struggled to fully pivot into general election mode.  Many observers both inside and outside the campaign will be watching for signs that Trump has reined in his shoot-from-the-hip excesses. Trump s children have long blamed Lewandowski and his  let Trump be Trump  strategy for their father s recent struggles   and for driving a wedge between Trump and advisers who dared suggest the candidate who ran roughshod over 16 GOP primary challengers needs to adjust his approach for the general election. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Kushner, whose influence has grown in recent months, had been trying to convince nervous, more mainstream Republicans that Trump was just doing what he had to do to win the primary and that a pivot was imminent.   They told people he inherently understood the tone and temperament required of a general election and that the real Trump was sophisticated, charming, successful   a dealmaker who would be able to cut the deal,  one high-level GOP source said.  But in the last six weeks, the best dealmaker of all time can't close the deal with his own party, and it s based on his temperament.  It's not issues, it's that people think he's mentally unfit to be president.  Manafort is working to build out the communications staff, a venture Lewandowski had repeatedly blocked. Beyond messaging, Trump has yet to spend significant time campaigning in swing states, traveling last week to deeply red states like Texas in order to play catch-up on the fundraising front.  On Tuesday, he continued his outreach to a core Republican constituency, meeting with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower in another effort to unify a fractured conservative coalition.  None of the eight organizers of the meeting was willing to officially endorse Trump afterward. Nor does this week s campaign shakeup obscure Trump s staggering financial disadvantage or the Republican Party s attempts to paint a more positive picture of the reality that its presumptive presidential nominee has less cash on hand than many congressional candidates. Sean Spicer, the RNC communications director, said it s silly to compare Trump s $1. 3 million cash-on-hand total to Clinton s $42. 5 million sum because the billionaire has self-financed much of his campaign to date.   If he wanted to get that number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it s up.  Trump himself vowed Tuesday to match any soft money contributions made over the following 48 hours up to $2 million, another effort to portray the situation as far from bleak but one that could backfire should donors believe that the campaign s finances are in good shape.  Part of the problem is he keeps saying,  I m gonna put that kind of money in,  which makes it very difficult for donors and   and someone like myself to try and raise money for him in a super PAC,  Ed Rollins, who formed a pro-Trump super PAC that has failed to gain traction, said Tuesday during an appearance on Fox Business Network.   People say 'Well, he says he can buy it himself.  Let him put the money in.   In the month since he became the presumptive GOP nominee, Trump raised just $3. 1 million; by comparison, Mitt Romney raised more than $23 million in the month after he clinched the nomination in 2012.  Of the $6. 7 million Trump s campaign has spent, roughly 20 percent (CNN says 17 percent) has gone to Trump-owned businesses.  Continuing to rely almost completely on his large media presence, Trump has spent almost nothing to date on data programs, television advertising and direct mail.  Trump and the RNC are holding a joint fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday night, but only a fraction of the money raised will go to his campaign. Two things are giving donors hesitation: that he's not doing well now, and that he's rich and can self-fund, said Charlie Black, an experienced GOP operative in Washington and Manafort s former partner.  And they haven't had a professional fundraising operation so far.  But he's cleared the deck of the divided leadership, and now [Manafort has the clear path to go and professionalize it.  He's got to make a bunch of phone calls, and he's got to staff up, said Austin Barbour, who served as a national finance chair for Romney's 2012 campaign.  Talking isn't going to get him there, he's got to do it.  And he's the tip of the spear when it comes to helping Republicans with the down-ballot campaigns. Just weeks ahead of the convention in Cleveland, Trump s woes have only added to Republicans  concerns about his candidacy and the negative impact he could have on down-ballot races.  And the presumptive nominee has yet to completely quiet chatter about the party s nuclear option: changing RNC rules a week ahead of the convention in order to unbind the delegates on a first ballot to allow them to nominate someone other than Trump. Gov.  Scott Walker, the former candidate who has hinted he d be open to receiving the nomination in such a circumstance, said Tuesday the delegates  should be able to vote the way they see fit.  Ken Vogel contributed to this report.   NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.  But as they left, many prominent figures indicated that Trump still hasn't sealed the deal. When eight leading Christian conservatives   including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Sealy Yates of Trump s evangelical advisory committee and Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B.  Anthony List   lined up for a news conference following a meeting with the candidate, not a single one was ready to fully endorse Trump and grant him access to their extensive networks of grass-roots activists. What they and other attendees offered instead was qualified encouragement for Trump, as many remarked that he had helped move them closer to an endorsement. That s a better take on Trump than many of the same leaders offered during the primary contests, but it still spells trouble.  At a stage of the campaign in which candidates are typically working to win over moderates and independents, the presumptive GOP nominee is still working to nail down support from one of his own party s core constituencies: Christian conservatives. On Tuesday, Trump made a full-throated appeal to religious Republicans.  Hundreds of evangelicals convened at a closed-door session at the cavernous Marriott Marquis in Times Square here for an all-day confab that featured appearances from various Trump representatives, including Ben Carson and Eric Trump, along with Trump himself. He used the meeting to paper over past differences with evangelicals, many of whom preferred Ted Cruz, Ben Carson or a host of other candidates over the eventual winner, as well as to highlight some areas of common ground, especially regarding his support for anti-abortion Supreme Court justices.  I ve been a Christian, and I love Christianity and the evangelicals have been so incredibly supportive,  Trump said in the private session, according to audio obtained by POLITICO.   Don t forget, when I ran, and all of a sudden I went to states that were highly evangelical, like as an example, South Carolina, and they said,  Well, Trump won t win this state because it s evangelical    not only did I win, I won in a landslide.   They really get me,  he continued, of evangelicals.   They understand.  And certainly, many of the die-hard conservatives here, who have no appetite for supporting Hillary Clinton, want a reason to get behind the GOP nominee.  By simply showing up, he moved closer to giving them one   but his work remains cut out for him.  I certainly liked what I saw today,  said Dr.  James Dobson, a veteran social conservative leader and previously vocal Trump critic. But despite being listed by the campaign as a member of Trump s evangelical advisory board, he said he wasn t yet prepared to endorse (endorsements weren t a requirement for joining the board).  It s early in the process, and there s plenty of time,  Dobson said, less than one month before the Republican National Convention commences.   But again, I m pleased by what I saw today.  That s about as far as I can go.  In an interview before the gathering, Perkins   a former Cruz backer   said he hoped to be able to eventually endorse Trump.   Because of the alternative, I would like to be at a point where I find that I can support him,  he said.   If I can support him, I think many other evangelical social conservatives can as well.  But it s going to be difficult because clearly there s a division right now in the evangelical ranks.  On Tuesday, Perkins said that the  conversation has begun today  and was complimentary of Trump, but said that he s still waiting to see whom Trump selects as a running mate, and how he reacts to a potentially very conservative platform at the RNC.  Is he learning in this process? I think he is,  Perkins said.   Now it s important [to see who he has around him.  In addition to giving the main address, Trump also met with about 50 of the country s most influential Christian conservative leaders, including Penny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America; Dannenfelser (who later said she would personally support backing Trump, but didn t know yet what the selection committee of her organization s political arm would do); and Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. , Nance said.  There, Trump railed against a culture of political correctness and stressed his support for defending religious liberty. There s more outreach to come.  Trump s campaign on Tuesday unveiled a list of more than two dozen Christian leaders who are members of his evangelical advisory board, including former Rep.  Michele Bachmann, Dobson, Falwell and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Trump needs those efforts to bear fruit.  Conservative Christians are an essential part of the GOP base, and turning them out is crucial for Republicans.  While Trump did win a significant slice of evangelical voters during the primary, as he noted to the group, many of the key leaders of the movement have stayed on the sidelines, depriving Trump of core activist support and sending a signal to other evangelicals that this election may be worth skipping, even as they remain steadfastly opposed to Clinton. The real estate mogul s past more-liberal record on social issues is still of significant concern, as is his history of antagonizing various minority groups, including prisoners of war and people with disabilities.  The awkward fit was on full display Tuesday when Trump posed for a photo with the Falwells.  In tweeting the photo, Falwell Jr.  said he was excited to be introducing Trump, but many pointed out that the trio was posing in front of a framed cover of Playboy magazine. Tuesday s events more broadly were aimed at strengthening the ties between Trump and the constituency he hopes to energize. Both the format and the moderator were sympathetic to that aim.  Former Arkansas Gov.  Mike Huckabee struck a reassuring and solicitous tone as he moderated the event.  Attendees weren t looking to elect a pastor, he told Trump, who last summer said he has never asked God for forgiveness.  There was no opportunity for follow-up questions or further probing on issues. Only a handful of questions   about Israel, religious liberty and immigration   were taken, and some attendees were disappointed that time ran out before Trump could be asked about abortion, an issue on which he s switched positions several times.  There s some things I d like to talk to him about, to hear a little more from him on the specific issue of Planned Parenthood,  Nance said.   But he really didn t hurt himself today.  He did, however, stress his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, saying that a conservative court would go a long way toward protecting anti-abortion measures, religious liberty and gun rights.  Trump repeatedly painted the election as a choice between his conservative court picks and Hillary Clinton s more reliably liberal ones.                             Clergy leaders demonstrate on June 21 in New York where Donald Trump is scheduled to meet evangelical clergy.     These will be Supreme Court justices that will be intellects, that will be talented men in what they do   and women   and also be pro-life,  he said, noting that in addition to the list of possible Supreme Court justices he has already released, he might have four or five names to add to the list down the road.  This next president   could have five justices in the Supreme Court,  he said.   Probably three, very possibly four, it could even be five.  If Hillary Clinton gets in, we know what she s going to put in there, we know what s going to happen.    We re going to end up being Venezuela, if she gets in, for a lot of different reasons.  Ultimately, the attendees  opposition to Clinton may be Trump s best hope for pulling their enthusiastic support, and he played to that anger Tuesday when he questioned Clinton s faith and suggested she would be problematic for religious Christians. But Reed, of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said that Trump gave attendees reason to be actively excited about him as well.  I think he had a good day,  he told reporters from POLITICO and National Review, going on to add,  He showed up.  He came to a meeting of over a thousand Christian leaders and spent hours hearing their concerns, receiving their wisdom and their counsel, and answering their questions.  And the second thing is, he made it very clear on matters of life, religious freedom, support for Israel, he stands with them.  Trump also suggested that he believes Christianity is under attack, a view shared by many in the room.  I ve talked about a temporary ban on Muslims, until we find out what s going on,  he said.   I was met with   everything.  Some people thought, great, some people didn t think so great.  If I said something about Christianity, it would be a whole different ballgame.  We can t let that happen, folks.  After Trump effectively clinched the nomination in May, many evangelical leaders grappled both with whether to endorse him, and, if they reached that point, whether to activate their extensive grass-roots networks on his behalf.  It was a question several top leaders in attendance were still pondering Tuesday as they left.  The choice isn t between supporting him and Hillary,  Nance said.   It s between supporting him, turning out the people they influence, or doing nothing.  She remains undecided as to her next step, as does Perkins. For Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative activist, it s an easier call.  Bauer, who was supporting Cruz, said he had to decided both to back Trump and to use his political organization to assist the presumptive GOP nominee.  He is planning a more formal endorsement in the coming weeks.  Look, it s a binary decision,  he said, going on to add.   We ll definitely be promoting the ideas that we agree with that he s standing for.  Outside the Marriott, a lone figure in a blue suit stood waging his own personal protest. Eric Teetsel, a Christian activist who ran religious outreach for Marco Rubio, stood by himself with a sign.   Torture is not pro-life,  his sign read.   Racism is not pro-life.  Misogyny is not pro-life.  Murdering the children of terrorists is not pro-life.   I may be standing here by myself, but I know I m not alone,  Teetsel said, going on to add,  There are millions of Christians who look at the candidates in this race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and say,  I can t vote for either of them in good conscience.   And they are wondering what to do.                   Donald Trump speaks at the Saint Andelm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire June 13.   Did he say anything? I had been interviewing a source, and I couldn t take my cellphone out of my pocket every time it buzzed.  So for 20 minutes, I was cut off from the outside world, I was cut off from him.  I was cut off from my Trump fix.  No Twitter.  No texts.  No websites.  No cable TV.  My palms were sweaty.  My heart was pounding.  Anything could have happened.  So I fired up my iPhone and checked Twitter.  The New York Times had the scoop:  Donald Trump Parts Ways With Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager.   Then there was this attack-tweet from Hillary Clinton s chief strategist Joel Benenson:  Polls drop.  Trump dumps mgr.  S.  Beckett:  There s man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet.    S.  Beckett refers to Samuel Beckett, an Irish playwright and Nobel Prize winner, who is currently dead.  The quotation came from Beckett s play  Waiting for Godot,  which debuted in 1953.  In it, people sit around and talk and talk while accomplishing virtually nothing.  The play is, in other words, a metaphor for modern presidential campaigning.  The Trump campaign officially tweeted:  The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.   This is standard pol-speak for:  Don t let the door hit you in the butt on your way out and if you try to steal any Sharpies, you will be arrested and beaten.   The Politico story quoted a senior Trump aide as saying that  Lewandowski was not getting along with the Republican National Committee, that there was a recognition that the campaign was falling behind Hillary Clinton from an infrastructure perspective and that there was recognition that Lewandowski was no longer up to the job.   In addition, there must have been a heck of a lot of Sharpies missing.  The story dominated cable, with CNN reporting that Ivanka Trump, Donald s oldest daughter, had a one-on-one meeting with her father over the weekend and demanded that Lewandowski be dumped.  Given the choice of picking a new campaign manager or picking a new oldest daughter, Trump went with Ivanka.  But getting rid of Lewandowski did serve one positive purpose.  It changed the Trump  story of the day    there always has to be at least one   away from a speech in which Trump had said:  Belgium is a beautiful city.   It is not.  And I don t need some Irish Nobel Prize winner to tell me that.  All I need is a map of Europe.  Belgium is a country.  Brussels, its capital, is a city.  Both begin with the letter  b,  which is why Trump ran into trouble.  He majored in screwing other people on bad deals, not geography.  So dumping Lewandowski, embarrassing as it was, gave the media something else to write about.  Like how embarrassing Trump s running mate is going to be.  Take Newt Gingrich.  Please.  Rick Tyler, a former Ted Cruz spokesman who was fired in February for posting fake tweets and Facebook entries about Marco Rubio   are you following all this?   said recently:  I don t know two other people who can command more media attention than Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump.  Keeping your enemies constantly on defense, constantly off balance, constantly explaining themselves.  Newt knows how to do that.   Newt also knows how to make news.  Like when he advocated building a permanent base on the moon by the end of his second presidential term and using the base for manned flights to Mars.  This is exactly the kind of vice president Trump needs.  It lets him say,  I might be nuts, but Newt is bat-poo crazy.  So don t even dream of impeaching me.   What Hillary needs to learn from all this is how to go on the offense against Trump.  She has to be proactive instead of reactive.  She has to make people say,  Did she say anything? Did I miss anything Hillary said?  And there are signs she is beginning to get it.  A few weeks ago, Hillary jumped all over Trump.   Donald Trump s ideas aren t just different   they are dangerously incoherent,  Clinton said.   They re not really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.   Trump reacted with typical aplomb: which is to say, he went into a series of bizarre rants.   I have a strong temperament, and it s a very good temperament and it s a very in control temperament or I wouldn t have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn t have built all of the things that I ve been able to do in life!  he spluttered.

They wanted to renew so badly, you have no idea.   Yes, we have no idea.  On Wednesday, Trump will fly to Scotland and then to Ireland to show off his golf courses there.

Podcast produced by Bridget Mulcahy.  PHOENIX   Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a  Happy Birthday  message.  Did he get in touch?  the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied,  no,  but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email.  A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite I love Sheriff Joe!It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14   but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens. Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate.  They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny  political correctness  of minority groups.  Arpaio hit on the formula first   adding a Korean War veteran s fondness for accumulating . 50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance   but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick.   I don t like people to say,  He s copying you,   Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast. As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does   but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence. During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others? Why would I bite the hand that feeds?  he said, shaking his head in disapproval. In Arpaio s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him.   I'm controversial,  he added with a shrug.   You wouldn't be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I don't think.  (In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed   he had the medical bills.  In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3. 75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriff's real estate transactions. )(Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York s tabloids.  Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being  controversial  was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation.  Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he s  strictly a self-made madman.  He s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news.  He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn t so bad ( there wasn't that much crime when the mob   now, I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too.  . . .  They will never kill a child or a cop, OK? ). He knew I was Jewish, so I got this:  Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security.  I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people.  I'm not just saying that because you're Jewish.  Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point.   The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky,  he added.   I don't know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money.  Actually, I'm the only one that ever busted that guy.  Do you know that?  (I did not. )Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus.  When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea   thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter   that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy. Whether it s gays, ISIS   there s one other [thing} that nobody is talking about.  Everybody there happened to be Latino.  Why?   because that was a night for Latino and Cuban,  he told me.   Why didn t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn t like it? Come on.  You re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS.  What about Hispanics? Why isn t anybody   why hasn t the news media even asked that question? Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded.  He was undeterred.  It could be because there is talk around the nation   there s a lot of people that don t like Hispanics.  Is that a secret?  he added. In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics. Oh, and he used county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama s  fake  birth certificate.  (An Arpaio-allied group later tried to reimburse the county for the expense but was rebuffed by the board of supervisors. ) That s what got him his first give- em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump.   That s not dead as far as I m concerned,  he told me. But beneath the bombast, there s a whisper of a showman s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump.  It s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician s power is ultimately derived from the news media   and when they turn on you, look out.  I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.   You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is.  That s the way it is in politics.  Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man s Donald Trump   same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio s life story he s the poor (or at last the working-class) man.  His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump s partial snub.  On June 14, 1932, Arpaio s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him.  His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store.  And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else s dinner table until his father remarried.  Eighty-four times   you have to look back at your life,  he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career   the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the  Trumpinator  at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood.   I never had a mother to grow up with, but that s the way it is.  . . .  It was a little difficult sometimes when you don t have a mother and you're bounced from one Italian family to another.  Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites.  Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country   a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself. The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino   a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics.  In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a  Make Maricopa Great Again  campaign.  Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer. Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment   and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control   has the same knack.   Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him,  he told me.   Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.  But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field.  He s running again this year and blames the Obama administration s campaign against his policies for the drop.  But local analysts noted a telling shift   support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age. Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over  out of spite.   He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration s racial profiling case   he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.  I think it's overstated,  he said.   I think there's a lot of hype.  Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say.  We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines.  So everybody has to be very careful.   You don't think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point?  I asked. His answer:  No.  No.  No, I really don t.  When I pointed out that many critics had called him  a racist,  he waved dismissively.  When they can't get you for anything else, it's a famous word,  racist,   he said.   Do you think it bothers me? It doesn't really bother me.  I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want.  . . .  [I m probably one guy that really doesn t [discriminate, you know, and I m not going to say my best friend is black.  . . .  No, no, no.  And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican.  I got all these family   but I m not going to say that.  I guess you could still have that and say you re a racist, you know, but no.  I know what I am.  Come on.  He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two ( he s got my underwear ) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate s claim of a  silent majority  that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters. Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.  All these politicians afraid to go near him,  he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.  I think everybody is looking at their own elections.  I hate to say that,  Arpaio added.   You know it; I know it.  You want me to say it, and I'm saying it.  . . .  People have to worry about their own future, their own elections.  I understand that.  But I'm not the type of guy that does that.  I don't throw people under the bus.  I know there s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote.  People are always saying,  Oh, you can t win if you don't have the Hispanic vote.   He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.  If there's anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it s me, with all the heat I m taking, right?  he said.   Any smart guy would do that, but I m not a smart guy, maybe.

I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.   You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is.  That s the way it is in politics.  Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man s Donald Trump   same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio s life story he s the poor (or at last the working-class) man.  His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump s partial snub.  On June 14, 1932, Arpaio s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him.  His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store.  And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else s dinner table until his father remarried.  Eighty-four times   you have to look back at your life,  he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career   the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the  Trumpinator  at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood.   I never had a mother to grow up with, but that s the way it is.  . . .  It was a little difficult sometimes when you don t have a mother and you're bounced from one Italian family to another.  Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites.  Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country   a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself. The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino   a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics.  In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a  Make Maricopa Great Again  campaign.  Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer. Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment   and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control   has the same knack.   Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him,  he told me.   Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.  But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field.  He s running again this year and blames the Obama administration s campaign against his policies for the drop.  But local analysts noted a telling shift   support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age. Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over  out of spite.   He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration s racial profiling case   he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.  I think it's overstated,  he said.   I think there's a lot of hype.  Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say.  We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines.  So everybody has to be very careful.   You don't think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point?  I asked. His answer:  No.  No.  No, I really don t.  When I pointed out that many critics had called him  a racist,  he waved dismissively.  When they can't get you for anything else, it's a famous word,  racist,   he said.   Do you think it bothers me? It doesn't really bother me.  I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want.  . . .  [I m probably one guy that really doesn t [discriminate, you know, and I m not going to say my best friend is black.  . . .  No, no, no.  And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican.  I got all these family   but I m not going to say that.  I guess you could still have that and say you re a racist, you know, but no.  I know what I am.  Come on.  He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two ( he s got my underwear ) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate s claim of a  silent majority  that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters. Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.  All these politicians afraid to go near him,  he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.  I think everybody is looking at their own elections.  I hate to say that,  Arpaio added.   You know it; I know it.  You want me to say it, and I'm saying it.  . . .  People have to worry about their own future, their own elections.  I understand that.  But I'm not the type of guy that does that.  I don't throw people under the bus.  I know there s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote.  People are always saying,  Oh, you can t win if you don't have the Hispanic vote.   He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.  If there's anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it s me, with all the heat I m taking, right?  he said.   Any smart guy would do that, but I m not a smart guy, maybe.                   House Speaker Paul Ryan was drowned out by the chants of House Democrats on the chamber's floor.   After a chaotic, daylong occupation of the House floor, Republican leaders moved in the wee hours of the night to cut off House Democrats' gun control "sit-in" by adjourning the House through the July 4 recess   without a gun vote. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) intends to quell the demonstration by having lawmakers vote at 2:30 a. m.  on several bills they had to pass this week, including one to combat the Zika virus.  After that, Republicans will send lawmakers home until July 5, starting their already-scheduled recess a few days earlier than planned. The move will deny Democrats any chance of votes on gun control legislation. Democrats will have to decide whether to continue their sit-in after the House adjourns.  Senior Democratic lawmakers had said the protest would continue through Thursday and Friday, but it's unclear how the sudden change in schedule will affect those plans.  Leadership's move came 15 hours after Democrats seized the House floor, vowing to block any House legislative action until Ryan promised to allow a roll call on what they believe is a reasonable proposal: blocking suspected terrorists on the no-fly list from purchasing guns. Ryan refused.  And Democrats said they were willing to hold the floor hostage all night and into Thursday and even Friday.  "I couldn't predict" how long it will go on, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md. ) told reporters around 10 p. m.  "I mean tomorrow, and the next day. . .  You've seen folks in the (House) gallery; they're pretty fired up on this.  It could go through Friday. "Republicans used a parliamentary maneuver after midnight to try to short-circuit the Democratic sit-in.  They rushed through debate on a funding bill to combat the Zika virus, as well as a measure to fund military construction and the Veterans Affairs department, setting up final votes on both measures for 2:30 a. m.  The chaotic day started around noon when Democrats took the chamber.  Republicans almost immediately recessed the House and turned off the chamber video cameras.  But that only drew more attention to the "sit-in," as lawmakers whipped out their phones and started streaming their efforts online, which was in turn broadcast by C-SPAN.  The protest soon became the story of the day, leading news websites across the nation. House leadership earlier in the day suggested they weren't interested in bringing security in to escort Democrats out, but they also weren't willing to give them the votes they wanted. If Ryan thought a few hours on the House floor would assuage the left, he was mistaken.  He entered the chamber at 10 p. m.  to break up the protest by moving to a vote on unrelated legislation to override an Obama administration rule.  But as he sought to restore order in the chamber, Democrats chanted "No bill, no break!"   a reference to the upcoming July recess they want to postpone until a vote on gun control is held. Earlier Wednesday, Ryan called the protest "nothing more than a publicity stunt," noting that the bill at issue was recently defeated in the Senate.  "We're not going to take away a citizen's constitutional rights without due process," the speaker told CNN. Ryan and other Republicans say that relenting to Democrats' demand would only encourage more protests and distort the majority party's prerogative to decide which bills reach the floor, a bad precedent for the House in general. The clash on the floor during the vote on the unrelated bill was ugly, a scene even longtime Hill observers have said they've never witnessed before.  Democrats who had been in the chamber all day for the protest moaned when the House stenographer came back into the chamber to take her spot, in preparation for the vote.  Several dozen Democrats sat in front of the House podium to fill the area where members occasionally cast votes. A few minutes before the vote started, as Ryan took to the podium and slammed his wooden gavel, Democrats started chanting.  Guests watching from the gallery inside joined in, pumped their fists in the air and clapping.  A few Republicans, entering the chamber for the vote, stood for several moments to take in the surreal scene.  Lawmakers held up signs with the names of victims of gun violence, creating a sea of stark white papers with bold black letters waiving on the House floor.  Other members held pictures of victims and signs that said  Disarm Hate  printed on a rainbow background. Just before the vote, Rep.  Gwen Moore (D-Wis. ) recited a poem on the floor about gun violence. Ryan tried to speak over the crowd to call the vote, but no one in the chamber could hear him.  Police quieted the public sitting in the gallery, in accordance with House rules that bar observers from cheering, but Democratic shouts still drowned out Ryan. Despite the inability to hear, he called the vote.  And Republicans started voting. Democrats were voting using paper cards   as opposed to the electronic vote House members normally employ   in an attempt to slow down the vote. Republicans mostly kept to their side of the room, some standing to watch while others sat and chatted among themselves. Throughout the vote, Democrats crowded the well, chanting and holding up the names of gun violence victims.  Give them a vote,  Democrats shouted, shaking their papers with victims  names. Earlier, as Ryan stepped off the dais at the beginning of the vote, Democrats booed the speaker and shouted "shame! shame! shame!" at him. And Democrats at one point during the same series sang "We Shall Overcome," echoing a crowd that sang the civil rights hymn hours earlier outside the Capitol. After the vote, several Democrats went outside the House to greet a crowd that had gathered during the day to support them.  Others stayed inside the gallery to continue blasting their GOP colleagues' unwillingness to do anything about what they believe is a major gun epidemic. Rep.  Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) walked over to the area Democrats were sitting and started lecturing them that the Orlando shooting was caused by "radical Islam"   and was not an issue of guns.  Gohmert and Rep.  Corrine Brown (D-Fla. ) got into a shouting match.  Lawmakers had to break them up, and House guards with the Sergeant at Arms took to the floor to ready for any more trouble.  Up in the visitors gallery, where onlookers had gathered to support Democrats in their protest, Capitol Police started escorting out some viewers they said had shouted at House Republicans during the vote.  That goes against House rules, which require viewers be silent and not disrupt the floor. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra and Rep.  Maxine Waters, both California Democrats, ran up the stairs to play mediator, eventually convincing security to allow their supporters to stay.

Chaka Fattah walks after leaving the federal courthouse in Philadelphia on  June 21  Convicted Democratic Rep.  Chaka Fattah submitted his letter of resignation from Congress Wednesday and said he wants to remain in the House until Oct.  3   the day before he is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court.  But now he appears to be having second thoughts. Fattah's initial stated desire to remain in Congress for months after he was found guilty on multiple counts of corruption stunned senior lawmakers in both parties, some of whom threatened to expel him.  Speaker Paul Ryan called on Fattah to resign immediately. "Mr.  Fattah has betrayed the trust of this institution and the people of Pennsylvania, and for that he should resign immediately from the House of Representatives," Ryan (R-Wis. ) said in a statement.  "We must hold members to the highest ethical standard, and I hope that Democratic leaders will join me in seeking his immediate resignation.  Following Ryan's statement   and facing the real possibility of expulsion   Fattah issued another statement signaling he was willing to step down sooner. "With that said, in further consultation with House Leadership, we are working to identify an agreeable time frame which will relieve the House of any distractions in carrying out the people s business," Fattah said.  "I hold the institution of the Congress of the United States in the highest regard and am thankful for the privilege to have served. "Fattah was convicted Tuesday on an array of federal corruption charges, including bribery.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct.  4.  The Pennsylvania Democrat is not allowed to vote on the floor or in committee.  After losing his April primary, following his indictment nine months earlier, Fattah was going to retire in January anyway.  Some Republicans have openly called for Fattah to resign or be expelled.  Democrats, for their part, assumed Fattah would quickly decide to leave on his own accord and most kept quiet about the issue. In a letter Wednesday to Ryan, Fattah initially declared that he would leave office, but not until Oct.  3, prior to his sentencing. "Despite my resignation, I am working to clear my name of these charges and plan to mount an appeal," Fattah said. Fattah also mentioned some of the major pieces of legislation he helped craft during his nearly 22-year career. Fattah, 59, had been charged with bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud, and filing false statements as part of a years-long criminal scheme that even included Fattah lobbying President Barack Obama for an appointment for one of his co-conspirators.

On this day in 1906, Speaker Joseph Cannon shattered his gavel while attempting to restore order during an acrimonious debate that occurred while the House sat as the Committee of the Whole.  The Illinois Republican banged his wooden gavel hard enough to knock off its head, which landed between the clerks on the lower tier of the rostrum.  In that era, House gavels commonly broke from overly strenuous use during raucous sessions.  Speaker Champ Clark of Missouri, a Democrat who presided over the House from 1911 to 1919, broke two gavels during the opening session of Congress from 1911 to 1913. Another Democrat, Speaker John Nance Garner of Texas, broke three gavels in his first week at the rostrum in 1931.  In March 1933, he stepped down as speaker to move to the Senate wing of the U. S.  Capitol as Franklin D.  Roosevelt s vice president.  Before departing from the House, Garner, weary of breaking gavels, ordered an  unbreakable  gavel made of black walnut, which was then further reinforced by a special curing process.  It didn t solve the problem. Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed, a Maine Republican, was known to be such an enthusiastic gavel wielder that he once splintered the rostrum.  When craftsmen tore away its felt covering after Congress adjourned in 1891, visitors came away with wood splinters as souvenirs. During his 17 years as speaker, Rep.  Sam Rayburn, a Texas Democrat who died in 1961, acquired an eclectic collection of gavels, each carved from a different piece of historic wood.  One such gavel was made of timber recovered from the White House after the British burned it down in 1814.  Rayburn once said,  In the speakership, the gavel becomes almost a part of the office.  It s habit.  Any gavel you use has a lot of sentiment attached.  Nowadays, the House carpentry shop fashions most of the wooden gavels used by presiding officers whenever the lawmakers convene. By contrast, the Senate s gavel is made of ivory.  Unable to obtain a piece of ivory large enough to replace a broken gavel, the Senate successfully appealed to the Indian Embassy for assistance.  The new gavel is shaped like an hourglass and has no handle.  It was first used on Nov.  17, 1954.  It replaced a gavel that had been in continuous use since the birth of the Republic in 1789.  Over the years, that gavel had deteriorated.  It finally cracked during the 1954 Senate session when Vice President Richard Nixon   while presiding over the Senate   used it once too often during a heated debate over nuclear energy policy.  Previously, silver plates had been added to both ends of the old gavel in a failed attempt to prevent further damage.  Today, both gavels are kept in a mahogany box that is carried to the Senate floor by a page before the Senate convenes.

John Lewis (center), participate in a sit-in June 22  on the House floor seeking a vote on gun control measures.   Rep.  John Yarmuth via APThat was definitely not your father s C-SPAN. Wednesday s dramatic protest on the House floor over gun control was a powerful reminder of how dramatically the cable network s role as the official chronicler of Congress has changed since its early years   and how technology has suddenly made C-SPAN less beholden to the congressional leaders who control its video feed inside the chambers. It all unfolded quickly: When the sit-in began Wednesday morning, Republican leaders ordered the House into recess.  And since only they, and not C-SPAN, oversee the camera, C-SPAN s feed was cut off, as dictated by the chamber s rules. Normally, that would have been end of story. But in a move that would not have been possible even five years ago, C-SPAN picked up a live video feed from a lawmaker recording the sit-in from inside the chamber   doing an end-run around House leaders. The video feed   and the power to control it   was once a real lever of power in Congress.  As a newcomer to the House in 1979 looking to make a name for himself, Newt Gingrich used C-SPAN, which had just launched months earlier, to full effect, regularly blasting Democrats before the budding audience of cable subscribers.  Five years later, after Gingrich accused Democrats of being  blind to communism,  House Speaker Tip O Neill used C-SPAN to exact revenge, ordering the House cameras to pan across an empty chamber as one Republican lawmaker was making a speech. Congress  tight control over what its viewers see has long been a source of frustration for C-SPAN, which has been trying to get its own cameras on the floor of since 1984.  But congressional leaders, whether Democratic or Republican, have maintained power over the cameras, the audio, the angles and when they re turned on and off. That all changed on Wednesday afternoon, when members of Congress themselves became the cameras, using their smartphones to broadcast the sit-in live directly to C-SPAN after the network s access to video feeds from the House floor was cut, despite the fact there were dozens of Democratic lawmakers still there, making speeches and making news.  Speaker of the House Rep.  Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) blasted the move, calling it a  publicity stunt.   His spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said that because the House had gone into recess, the feed had to go.  Rules are rules. But C-SPAN soon found a way around those rules.  This is a milestone moment,  said C-SPAN spokesman Howard Mortman, who said he was inundated with calls and interest on Wednesday.   We ve got a commitment to C-SPAN as a public service, a privately funded public service to connect Americans to Congress to show what's happening in Congress   this certainly rises to the event of something happening in Congress. " With the cameras turned off, C-SPAN began broadcasting a Periscope livestream of the floor from Rep.  Scott Peters (D-Calif. ), with the full graphics afforded to normal video feeds of the House floor.  The network also switched at times to a Facebook Live feed from Rep.  Beto O Rourke (D-Texas) and others.  All three cable networks also picked up on portions of the livestream, but C-SPAN carried it for the entire duration and continues to do so as of this publishing. "Cameras in chamber controlled by house.  House is currently in recess subject to call.  House cameras are not permitted to show sit-in," read the "Alert" on the bottom of C-SPAN s shot explaining the situation.  Peters, speaking just off the House floor on an aide s phone while his own kept up the broadcast, told POLITICO the idea for the livestream came from a young aide, who texted him the suggestions.  Having never used the services before, Peters said he downloaded the Periscope app from the House floor and began broadcasting.  Technically, it s against House rules to film from the House floor.  But Peters said the sit-in was breaking the rules anyway, so he figured he d keep going.  This is a protest.  If Rep.  John Lewis is going to sit on the House floor, that s against the rules, so I thought it s better for people to know about it,  Peters said.   I think it s appropriate as part of a protest.  I really respect the rules of the House and don t expect to break them, but today I think it s appropriate for the American people to know what the heck is going on. "About six phones were livestreaming at a time, Peters guessed.  At one point, he said, CBS called trying to connect to his feed.  The attention is vital to the keeping up the sit-in, Peters said:  If no one were watching or knew we were here, it would be more difficult to sustain.  We don t have a filibuster mechanism that keeps the House open.  We re technically in adjournment so it s really the only way for us to make a point. "In the past, lawmakers hoping to pull off similar stunts would have been out of luck.  In 2008, when they were in power, Democrats recessed and even cut power when a group of Republican lawmakers, led by then-Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) opposed a motion to adjourn the House, arguing that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to schedule a vote allowing offshore drilling was hurting the American economy.  They refused to leave the floor for five hours, but the only way the protest was broadcast was via reporters observing from the press galleries.  It s always a big misunderstanding.  People think we re in charge of the cameras but we re not, we re not the government,  C-SPAN s Mortman said.   This is an opportunity to explain how we operate and how TV gets from the House floor into American households.  This is a great moment.   Both Twitter and Facebook have invested heavily in Capitol Hill, dedicating staff members to training members of Congress on how to use their competing livestream features.

House Democrats, including Rep.  Joe Courtney (left) and Rep.  John Lewis (center), participate in a sit-in June 22  on the House floor seeking a vote on gun control measures.   Rep.  John Yarmuth via APThat was definitely not your father s C-SPAN. Wednesday s dramatic protest on the House floor over gun control was a powerful reminder of how dramatically the cable network s role as the official chronicler of Congress has changed since its early years   and how technology has suddenly made C-SPAN less beholden to the congressional leaders who control its video feed inside the chambers. It all unfolded quickly: When the sit-in began Wednesday morning, Republican leaders ordered the House into recess.  And since only they, and not C-SPAN, oversee the camera, C-SPAN s feed was cut off, as dictated by the chamber s rules. Normally, that would have been end of story. But in a move that would not have been possible even five years ago, C-SPAN picked up a live video feed from a lawmaker recording the sit-in from inside the chamber   doing an end-run around House leaders. The video feed   and the power to control it   was once a real lever of power in Congress.  As a newcomer to the House in 1979 looking to make a name for himself, Newt Gingrich used C-SPAN, which had just launched months earlier, to full effect, regularly blasting Democrats before the budding audience of cable subscribers.  Five years later, after Gingrich accused Democrats of being  blind to communism,  House Speaker Tip O Neill used C-SPAN to exact revenge, ordering the House cameras to pan across an empty chamber as one Republican lawmaker was making a speech. Congress  tight control over what its viewers see has long been a source of frustration for C-SPAN, which has been trying to get its own cameras on the floor of since 1984.  But congressional leaders, whether Democratic or Republican, have maintained power over the cameras, the audio, the angles and when they re turned on and off.

Sen.  Chuck Schumer: "There are a few concerns that are being worked on and I believe will be worked out, and I have every expectation of supporting the bill. "  John ShinkleSenate Democrats are coalescing behind a gun control compromise drafted in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in modern U. S.  history, amplifying pressure on the Republican authors of the bill to find more GOP backers on a measure that is opposed by the powerful National Rifle Association.  The top three Senate Democratic leaders said Wednesday they would support the compromise being drafted by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) and a bipartisan coalition of senators, which would allow the Justice Department to block people on two key federal terror lists from purchasing firearms. Senior Democrats predicted as many as 40 Democratic senators could ultimately back Collins, though the fine print of her bill continued to be in flux.   I m all for a bipartisan compromise,  Sen.  Chuck Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, said Wednesday evening.   There are a few concerns that are being worked on and I believe will be worked out, and I have every expectation of supporting the bill.  Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office continued to give no indication Wednesday when the Collins plan would come up for a vote.  According to multiple sources, one option under discussion that could tee up a Thursday vote was moving to table the Collins gun plan, which its supporters are trying to add as an amendment to a broader funding bill for the Justice Department.  There would need to be 51 votes for the Collins proposal to be tabled.  The twist is that it may not get tabled because most of the 46-member Senate Democratic Caucus and at least a half-dozen Republicans support the Collins measure.  But it would be a way for McConnell to demonstrate that the compromise did not have 60 votes needed to advance essentially any legislation in the Senate.  A McConnell spokesman said Wednesday evening that there were no announcements to make on scheduling of votes. Meanwhile, a handful of Senate Republicans up for reelection   who are facing perhaps the most scrutiny on gun measures   cast significant doubt whether the Collins proposal was something they could support.  That meant reaching 60 votes remained a significant hurdle. And Republicans, including those pushing for the compromise and senators who are undecided, have to reckon with the expansive influence of the NRA.  The gun-rights group has denounced the Collins plan as  unconstitutional,  effectively ensuring most Republicans will oppose it.  Pro-gun control advocates were doing their own lobbying, with Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep.  Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz. ), personally calling GOP senators to urge a compromise on barring potential terrorists from obtaining firearms.  It ll have some impact.  I don t know how much,  said Sen.  Jeff Flake of Arizona, one Republican supporting the compromise proposal, of the NRA opposition.   Most people are concerned about doing something that helps and with due process provisions.  And this has it.   Other top Senate Republicans indicated they wished the NRA would ve held off on opposing it.  I mean, my preference would be that they wait until we get final language before they react to it too much,  said Sen.  John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Senate Republican.   I think until it s final language, it s been, kind of, in a continual state of evolution.  Collins and her cohorts picked up support from another Senate Republican on Wednesday: Mark Kirk of Illinois, who has usually voted with Democrats on gun policy.  But other vulnerable GOP senators echoed concerns voiced by some in Republican leadership   that Collins  bill lacked sufficient review for people who may be denied a gun because they wrongly ended up on either the No-Fly list or the so-called Selectee list.  Between the two federal lists, about 109,000 people could potentially be barred from purchasing weapons, with just 2,700 of them being U. S.  citizens or green-card holders, according to the bill s authors.  Sen.  Rob Portman of Ohio, who s facing a serious Democratic challenge in his reelection bid, continued to voice due process concerns on Wednesday.  Sen.  John McCain of Arizona said  of course I have concerns; that s why I m reviewing.   Sen.  Richard Burr of North Carolina said he had similar problems with the bill, and added another: the 14-day period, during which the federal government has to make its case for denying a gun sale if that decision is appealed, is too long.   I think there s still some very serious concerns about  due process provisions in Collins  plan, said Sen.  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, another vulnerable Senate Republican.   Listen, I think there s a way of doing this, but I don t think they re doing it yet.  Flake and others are also lobbying Sen.  Marco Rubio (R-Fla. ), who just announced Wednesday that he would run for reelection and who represents the state where the Orlando massacre, which killed 49 people and injured dozens of others, occurred June 12.  Rubio s office said the senator is reviewing the legislation but he had made no final decision.  Two other Senate Republicans running in high-profile reelection bids this fall   Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania   are supporting the Collins legislation.  Sen.  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a perennial GOP deal maker, also backs the bill. Both Ayotte, a former prosecutor, and Collins dismissed the prospect of including a provision that would require the federal government to show probable cause that the person buying a gun would commit terrorism   a standard favored by Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas.  I am not for probable cause being the standard,  Collins said.   If probable cause is the standard, you could arrest the people  rather than merely denying them a gun.  The quiet lobbying, persuasion tactics and legislating were happening in the Senate as their Democratic counterparts in the House seized control of their chamber earlier Wednesday.  Dozens of House lawmakers commandeered the floor and launched a high-profile sit-in at the well of the chamber to demand Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) hold a gun control vote.  That tactic was akin to the nearly 15-hour gun filibuster led by Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) and other Senate Democrats last week.  Indeed, more than two dozen Senate Democrats visited the House chamber, which stayed in recess for much of the day Wednesday, to show their support.  Sen.  Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and the party s chief vote-counter, said he would also back the legislation and he believed most of the 46-member Senate Democratic Caucus would rally around the Collins plan.   Certainly, a lot of these Republicans are going to have to face the music when one of their own comes up with a bipartisan amendment to address this issue,  Durbin said, as he walked over to the House chamber to lend support to Democrats staging the sit-in.   It makes it more difficult for them to vote no.                   Sen.

Certainly, a lot of these Republicans are going to have to face the music when one of their own comes up with a bipartisan amendment to address this issue,  Durbin said, as he walked over to the House chamber to lend support to Democrats staging the sit-in.   It makes it more difficult for them to vote no.   While Hillary Clinton was rallying with House Democrats at a high-profile meeting Wednesday morning in the Capitol Hill basement, one senior lawmaker was missing.  Connecticut Rep.  John Larson skipped the rare session with his party s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian.  Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the House? Larson was told that it was an  unprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be.   It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House, which is exactly what happened.  As Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition, Larson and Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. )   with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats   wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando.  And Wednesday s protest was nothing if not dramatic   an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue.  Longtime House watchers hadn t seen anything quite like it in many years, if at all.  If Republicans stuck together, Democrats would never be able to move their favored proposals, including blocking gun purchases by anyone on the federal  no fly  list, and expanded background checks for gun sales.  So Larson and Lewis and a handful of their colleagues decided to copy a GOP tactic from when Republicans were in the minority in 2008: Get dozens of members to go on the floor and refuse to leave.  Demand action or say they won t let the House adjourn in mid-July.  Block the House from any business until Republicans give in.  Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican leaders could either yield and allow a vote   extremely unlikely   or House Democrats would bring new attention to the issue.  It was the GOP tactic on steroids, this time in the era of widespread social media.  And the passion of Democrats on guns far exceeded that of Republicans eight years ago, when the GOP was demanding more offshore oil drilling.  The plan was laid out at a Tuesday night meeting with Larson and about a dozen Democrats.  They met in the office of Rep.  Katherine Clark of Massachusetts to hash out a plan to force a vote on the matter.  The lawmakers decided they were ready to play hardball   even if it meant shutting down their half of Congress for an entire day, or longer.   Most of the members didn t even know what was going ahead for us,  Lewis told C-SPAN.   We never said anything or shared anything.   When Lewis and Larson led their band of roughly two dozen Democrats onto the floor Wednesday to begin their sit-in, they staged the equivalent of the Senate s filibuster.  What began as an intricate behind-the-scenes plot with a handful of members grew to include almost the entire 188-person Democratic Caucus.  Releasing their pent-up anger over the nation s gun laws after the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, they took over the House floor for hours, plopping down and shutting down all legislative business until GOP leadership would allow a vote.   We said at the beginning of this week that we would use every tool in our toolbox,  Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ) said.   We said some of those tools involved hammers.  Some of those tools involved screwdrivers.  Some are blunt, some not.  We re going to keep using every single tool.   Hill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings.  In the Senate, Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes.  Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine).  House Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days.  There had been talk about trying a discharge petition   doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote   but they didn t have the support and it would take too long.  So they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy.  On Sunday, Pelosi called Israel, her caucus  top messager, and asked him to come up with a list of ways they could force the issue in the House before the chamber left for its July 4 recess.  They spoke again later that day with representatives from roughly 100 gun-control advocacy groups to discuss other options, coming up with the  No Bill, No Break  mantra that House Democrats would start chanting on the floor Tuesday when Republicans refused to recognize Rep.  Jim Clyburn (D-S. C. ) for a vote.  Israel came up with a list of options that Pelosi floated to the fuller Democratic Caucus on a conference call Monday, including asking for a vote in a motion to recommit.  The Democratic plan was to keep trying anything they could and keep causing a scene in hopes of increasing pressure on Republicans to let members go on record in a roll-call vote.  Separately, a small group of rank-and-file Democrats was plotting on its own.  Just before the week s first series of votes Tuesday evening, as lawmakers were flying back to Washington from their districts, Clark hosted a meeting in her office to brainstorm ways to force a vote.                              Rep.  Suzanne Bonamici via APLarson, whose Connecticut district is near the Sandy Hook elementary school where 20 children were shot to death in 2012, helped drive the conversation.  About 12 to 15 people showed, a source present said, including Rep.  Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn. )  We wanted to make sure the House couldn t proceed until we got a vote,  said one Democratic source.  Democratic leaders caught wind of the meeting and approved the plan but gave one bit of advice: Go big.  If you pursue such an overt demonstration, leaders said, according to one Democratic leader,  seize the opportunity  and make sure it succeeded by tapping a big name to lead the protest.  The group s choice for leader was an easy one: Civil rights leader John Lewis, who decades ago protested racial inequality during his own sit-ins in the South.  Clark and Larson asked him to take the lead.  Lewis accepted, later holding another meeting in his office Tuesday night to finalize their plans.  Some were a bit concerned about the timing.  One Democratic aide told Politico he was worried that the sit-in happening on the day that Clinton came to Capitol Hill would look staged and coordinated, when the effort began organically among rank-and-file lawmakers.  But with the House scheduled to adjourn on Friday for recess, it was now or never.  On Wednesday, just before Clinton arrived to meet with Democrats and as Larson went to speak to the parliamentarian, Pelosi stood up at a conference meeting to rally the troops.   Many of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow.  These moments of silence have almost become a moment of denial because it s a denial of what we need to do,  Pelosi said.   Now, many of you have said, we want to be disruptive, we want to be dilatory, we want to make sure the public knows that there is an opportunity to get this done.  This isn t about politics, it s not about elections, it s not about campaigns.  It s much bigger than that.   John Bresnahan contributed to this report.   While Hillary Clinton was rallying with House Democrats at a high-profile meeting Wednesday morning in the Capitol Hill basement, one senior lawmaker was missing.  Connecticut Rep.  John Larson skipped the rare session with his party s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian.  Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the House? Larson was told that it was an  unprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be.   It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House, which is exactly what happened.  As Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition, Larson and Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. )   with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats   wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando.  And Wednesday s protest was nothing if not dramatic   an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue.  Longtime House watchers hadn t seen anything quite like it in many years, if at all.  If Republicans stuck together, Democrats would never be able to move their favored proposals, including blocking gun purchases by anyone on the federal  no fly  list, and expanded background checks for gun sales.  So Larson and Lewis and a handful of their colleagues decided to copy a GOP tactic from when Republicans were in the minority in 2008: Get dozens of members to go on the floor and refuse to leave.  Demand action or say they won t let the House adjourn in mid-July.  Block the House from any business until Republicans give in.  Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican leaders could either yield and allow a vote   extremely unlikely   or House Democrats would bring new attention to the issue.  It was the GOP tactic on steroids, this time in the era of widespread social media.  And the passion of Democrats on guns far exceeded that of Republicans eight years ago, when the GOP was demanding more offshore oil drilling.  The plan was laid out at a Tuesday night meeting with Larson and about a dozen Democrats.  They met in the office of Rep.  Katherine Clark of Massachusetts to hash out a plan to force a vote on the matter.  The lawmakers decided they were ready to play hardball   even if it meant shutting down their half of Congress for an entire day, or longer.   Most of the members didn t even know what was going ahead for us,  Lewis told C-SPAN.   We never said anything or shared anything.   When Lewis and Larson led their band of roughly two dozen Democrats onto the floor Wednesday to begin their sit-in, they staged the equivalent of the Senate s filibuster.  What began as an intricate behind-the-scenes plot with a handful of members grew to include almost the entire 188-person Democratic Caucus.  Releasing their pent-up anger over the nation s gun laws after the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, they took over the House floor for hours, plopping down and shutting down all legislative business until GOP leadership would allow a vote.   We said at the beginning of this week that we would use every tool in our toolbox,  Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ) said.   We said some of those tools involved hammers.  Some of those tools involved screwdrivers.  Some are blunt, some not.  We re going to keep using every single tool.   Hill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings.  In the Senate, Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes.  Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine).  House Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days.  There had been talk about trying a discharge petition   doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote   but they didn t have the support and it would take too long.  So they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy.  On Sunday, Pelosi called Israel, her caucus  top messager, and asked him to come up with a list of ways they could force the issue in the House before the chamber left for its July 4 recess.  They spoke again later that day with representatives from roughly 100 gun-control advocacy groups to discuss other options, coming up with the  No Bill, No Break  mantra that House Democrats would start chanting on the floor Tuesday when Republicans refused to recognize Rep.  Jim Clyburn (D-S. C. ) for a vote.  Israel came up with a list of options that Pelosi floated to the fuller Democratic Caucus on a conference call Monday, including asking for a vote in a motion to recommit.  The Democratic plan was to keep trying anything they could and keep causing a scene in hopes of increasing pressure on Republicans to let members go on record in a roll-call vote.  Separately, a small group of rank-and-file Democrats was plotting on its own.  Just before the week s first series of votes Tuesday evening, as lawmakers were flying back to Washington from their districts, Clark hosted a meeting in her office to brainstorm ways to force a vote.                              Rep.  Suzanne Bonamici via APLarson, whose Connecticut district is near the Sandy Hook elementary school where 20 children were shot to death in 2012, helped drive the conversation.  About 12 to 15 people showed, a source present said, including Rep.  Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn. )  We wanted to make sure the House couldn t proceed until we got a vote,  said one Democratic source.  Democratic leaders caught wind of the meeting and approved the plan but gave one bit of advice: Go big.  If you pursue such an overt demonstration, leaders said, according to one Democratic leader,  seize the opportunity  and make sure it succeeded by tapping a big name to lead the protest.  The group s choice for leader was an easy one: Civil rights leader John Lewis, who decades ago protested racial inequality during his own sit-ins in the South.  Clark and Larson asked him to take the lead.  Lewis accepted, later holding another meeting in his office Tuesday night to finalize their plans.  Some were a bit concerned about the timing.  One Democratic aide told Politico he was worried that the sit-in happening on the day that Clinton came to Capitol Hill would look staged and coordinated, when the effort began organically among rank-and-file lawmakers.  But with the House scheduled to adjourn on Friday for recess, it was now or never.  On Wednesday, just before Clinton arrived to meet with Democrats and as Larson went to speak to the parliamentarian, Pelosi stood up at a conference meeting to rally the troops.   Many of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow.  These moments of silence have almost become a moment of denial because it s a denial of what we need to do,  Pelosi said.   Now, many of you have said, we want to be disruptive, we want to be dilatory, we want to make sure the public knows that there is an opportunity to get this done.  This isn t about politics, it s not about elections, it s not about campaigns.  It s much bigger than that.   John Bresnahan contributed to this report.                   On the issue of NATO, Donald Rumsfeld suggested that the media hasn t accurately portrayed Donald Trump s position on the institution. Donald Rumsfeld, George W.  Bush s first defense secretary, said he  can t imagine  not voting for Donald Trump in November. Rumsfeld, speaking to Fox News  Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday night, said he is  clearly  going to vote for Trump before going on to list reasons for which he couldn t vote for Hillary Clinton. Clinton s opponent in the Democratic primary, Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders, has some things in common with Trump, Rumsfeld remarked.  There is something happening that those two people could draw 25,000 human beings to hear them speak and I think that we ought to give some credence to that and understand that that s real,  he said. On the issue of NATO, Rumsfeld suggested that the media hasn t accurately portrayed Trump s position on the institution.  I had a staff person go back and tell me precisely what Trump did say about NATO and then I compared it with what the media and his opponents are saying he said about NATIO and there s a difference,  he said. Van Susteren also asked Rumsfeld about which candidate would be better at taking down ISIL.  I think the idea of four more years of what we ve had over the past seven or eight is not going to do it,  he said. Other Republican foreign-policy heavyweights have been silent about   if not outright hostile toward   Trump, and few have endorsed him.  Earlier on Wednesday, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton, praising her  deep expertise in international affairs, and a sophisticated understanding of the world.

Marco Rubio's fellow presidential also-rans in the Senate, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, didn't have much to say about Rubio running for reelection.   By all rights, fellow Senate Republicans should be excited that Marco Rubio wants to remain a senator   and help them keep their majority. But minutes after Rubio went public with his reelection bid, Ted Cruz had nothing to say about his former presidential rival.   Just call my press office,  Cruz said as a press aide walked behind him.  Pressed again, the aide firmly said:  He s not gonna talk about it.  Rubio s already favored to keep the seat he once promised to vacate.  But his electoral decision also makes it much more likely that the Senate Republican Conference will be even more crowded with a full stable of striving pols like Cruz and Rubio all committed to reshaping the GOP after Donald Trump s presidential run.  It s good to have a bunch of ambitious, rambunctious youngsters like us,  said Sen.  Tim Scott of South Carolina, a popular lawmaker also on an upward trajectory. Of course, it can also mean clashes between competing egos and ideological agendas.  Or in Scott s diplomatic words:  It just means we ll have more interesting family conversations.  Provided Rubio and Sen.  Rand Paul of Kentucky win reelection in races in which they are favored, they will rejoin a conference filled with relatively young senators who will be the focus of endless speculation about their future over the next four years.  There s mild-mannered conservative Scott, hawkish veteran Tom Cotton of Arkansas, never-Trump leader Ben Sasse of Nebraska, low-key Joni Ernst of Iowa, energetic Cory Gardner of Colorado and Cruz, who later issued a statement supporting Rubio. Republicans insist it s a good problem to have: Big names translate to lots of attention on the Senate and its rising stars.  But it can get messy, too: The Senate offers the perfect platform for ideological grandstanding and a single senator can shut the chamber down in an instant.  I still remember what Sen.  McConnell told me when I got here:  Welcome to the United States Senate, 100 significant egos and 200 sharp elbows.   So it s nothing new,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas.   We have a lot of people not running for office who exert their rights as a senator and can make things more challenging.  Still, Cornyn acknowledged the number of GOP senators looking for the spotlight is likely only to increase ahead of the next presidential election, compared to this year, when four GOP senators ran for president.  In particular, Cruz, Rubio and Paul were supposed to form the core of a GOP presidential field that ultimately could not compete with Trump.  It s going to be d j  vu all over again isn t it?  said Sen.  Bob Corker of Tennessee (R-Tenn. ).   I d rather be talking about all the talent on our side than the lack thereof.  Increasingly, the Senate serves as a launchpad for presidential contenders: Rubio and Cruz were the last two Republicans in the race that had any hope of beating Trump.  And as they prepared to pursue the GOP nomination, Cruz, Paul, Rubio and Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ) each used their status as powerful members of Congress to establish a national political profile, whether through compromise or conflict. Cruz famously used a filibuster to stoke a government shutdown in 2013, which boosted his profile but drove deep cracks in the GOP, and Paul single-handedly provoked a 2015 shutdown of some of the national s surveillance programs.  Later on the campaign trail, Cruz, Rubio and Paul spent months attacking one another in often blunt terms, forcing other Republican senators to choose sides or stay silent. Those wounds may not be fully healed.  And neither Cruz, nor Paul was feeling particularly loquacious on the topic of Rubio on Wednesday.  I wish him the best of luck,  Paul said.  Asked how his relationship with Rubio is these days, he replied:  I don t really want to do anymore interview than that.  Whether the Senate s biggest names can all pull together   and perhaps aid one another   over the next four months will have a significant impact on their future aspirations: If Republicans lose the majority, it will hurt their ability to set the agenda and use chairmanships to drive their message.  Rubio and Cruz, for example, have used subcommittee chairmanships to take out their frustrations on President Barack Obama and highlight issues important to them.  And Rubio in particular blamed four years of serving in the Democratic majority for souring his view of the Senate. Senate GOP leaders are taking things one step at a time: Their biggest goal at this point is simply to hold onto the majority and deal with the fallout from a crowded caucus later.  And Rubio moved the GOP ever closer to that goal by changing the dynamic of a Senate race that was getting away from Republicans.  I m pretty excited about it,  said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ).   It shouldn t be surprising to anybody we didn t want to lose him and the clearest way to keep the seat was trying to convince him to run again.  But some senators are beginning to think about what the party might look like after Trump s completed his run for president and the election is over.  The Republican majorities in the House and Senate have made initial progress clearing some deadlines from the calendar, but haven t touched contentious issues like immigration reform or a criminal justice overhaul.  And there s a government shutdown threat to deal with this fall that could hang over into next year, when the debt ceiling will again need to be raised. With a new president, Congress is likely to be invigorated by big ideas rather than the narrow priorities that McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been able to work on with Obama.  And that s where clashes among the GOP s best-known senators are most likely to manifest themselves. Rubio took the plunge into immigration reform in 2013, a move that may have hindered his presidential run among conservatives but could be beneficial to his standing in Florida.  His pursuit of normalization for undocumented immigrants runs counter to staunch conservatives like Cruz and Cotton, while newer members like Gardner and Ernst have never confronted the matter.  Congress hasn t engaged in a debate about authorizing war either   a major litmus test for those seeking the job of commander in chief. Deferred action on big-ticket policy items means that 2017 will be a major opportunity for the GOP to begin rethinking itself   particularly if it suffers a debilitating loss this year. To take over the party post-Trump, Graham advised the next generation of national candidates to think about growing the tent and competing with Democrats directly for young and minority voters.  That means confronting immigration reform and climate change rather than opposing Democratic efforts to address those issues.  You ve got to prove to people that you re bigger than your party and that you re a person of accomplishment,  Graham said.   The more on your r sum  that you did things that are hard that mattered, the better off you re going to be.  If your r sum  is: I m the chief guy who says  no?  That s not going to take you to the general election.

Donald Trump s Wednesday attack on Hillary Clinton was, for many Republicans, exactly what they d been waiting for: a disciplined, scripted attack on what the GOP contends is a deeply flawed Democratic candidate. But with Trump, it s never quite that simple: Even as some Republicans praised his anti-Clinton jeremiad, others ripped their party s presumptive nominee for pushing a policy agenda that, at points, strayed far from the party line.  There was a lot to like.  He did an effective job of connecting Hillary Clinton to the Washington cartel that is the insiders game and effectively connected her to her record . . .  He effectively gave the voters a choice between more of the same, anemic job growth versus a new vision,  said Rick Tyler, the former communications director for Sen.  Ted Cruz s presidential campaign. But in his assessment of Trump s economic proposals, Tyler was more muted:  I don't think he s ideologically steeped in how economies work,  he said of Trump. Others couldn t get past Trump s attacks on international trade deals, which have often enjoyed Republican support over the objections of Democrats.  This is a populist speech.  It speaks for a faction of the Republican Party but it certainly does not speak for most people who have considered themselves economic conservatives,  said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market R Street Institute think tank and former speechwriter for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, noting Trump s broadside against the North American Free Trade Agreement.   NAFTA and free trade agreements like it are key to the open and competitive economy that conservatives have traditionally favored.  The rift between Trump and conservatives is nothing new.  Throughout the primary, Trump turned his heterodox views into an asset, painting himself as a fighter for the American worker who was the lone candidate capable of taking power away from the elites and restoring prosperity to a working class in decline.  But that message has gotten lost of late amid Trump s attacks on a federal judge and his harsh comments about Muslims. On Wednesday, Trump was much more disciplined, making an explicit appeal to Bernie Sanders  supporters and lifting the Vermont senator s language on a  rigged  economy and framing of a struggle between  large corporations  and struggling American workers. It s a delicate dance for Trump as he works to expand his support past the base that propelled him to the top of the GOP field but still leaves him trailing Clinton in national polls.  Traditionally, the onset of general election has seen candidates work to win over moderates, but Trump seemed to be aiming Wednesday s speech at the  radical center    downscale white voters who generally don t fit on the traditional political spectrum. If so, his conservative critics said, it was unlikely that Trump s message would win over new supporters.   I can t see this speech getting anybody who doesn t support Trump already to support him and a handful of people who might think that he s going to temper some of this economic populism will probably be sorely disappointed,  said Lehrer. Still, Trump and the GOP remain in lockstep in one area: their disapproval of Clinton, both in her personal dealings and her policy record.  It s a good start because it walks through both the failures that Hillary had and where he wants to go,  said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.   What people need to see and hear is the focus he had in the primaries which was so effective: jobs: jobs, jobs.  And Rush Limbaugh, for one, was delighted by the tack Trump took in ripping Clinton, saying he would traffic in territory that other Republicans wouldn t. Indeed, many of Trump s attacks were either unsourced or were at odds with publicly available information   his assertion, for instance, that Clinton is backed financially by  Communist China    but Limbaugh saw that as Trump being willing to take off the gloves in a way that a more genteel class of politician wouldn t.  So Trump basically said things about Hillary Clinton that you just don't hear Republicans saying   But you just do not hear Mitt Romney say this, for example.  You wouldn't hear the Bush family talk this way about Hillary,  Limbaugh said.   You wouldn't hear fellow establishment types talk about this, 'cause it's too close to home for all of them.  But Trump can say this stuff as an outsider.  Following Trump's speech, Tucker Carlson, editor in chief of conservative website The Daily Caller, captured conservatives' ongoing ambivalence over their party's presumptive nominee: "Like everything with Trump, it was both exhilarating to hear someone tell the truth but very frustrating to hear someone articulate it badly or muddy it with irrelevancies.

"Nick Gass contributed to this report.  Donald Trump s campaign is preparing a sophisticated operation to fight back against resurgent plans by recalcitrant conservatives to deny him the nomination at next month s Republican National Convention. In a Tuesday night conference call led partly by Trump s top adviser Paul Manafort and including 200 staffers and volunteers, Trump s senior convention aides sketched out a whip operation led by a half-dozen operatives with deep convention experience.  The effort will rely on a team of 150 volunteers and paid staff to keep the convention s 2,472 delegates in line, and it will utilize a database with information on many of the delegates. The plans laid out during the call suggest that Trump s campaign is working to reverse a narrative that it has lacked organization, and the planning also indicates that Trump s aides are taking seriously efforts by his GOP opponents to out-maneuver him on the convention floor. The campaign is planning to reveal an additional eight  regional whip  leaders in the coming days, sources familiar with the operation said.  Each will oversee seven of the 56 states and territories sending delegations to Cleveland. The team will be overseen primarily by Doug Davenport, a former lobbying associate of Manafort, who was brought on board by the Trump campaign in April to court supportive delegates. Mike McSherry, a veteran Republican operative and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, will handle operations pertaining to three crucial convention committees.  That includes the rules committee, where hardcore Trump resisters intend to force a vote on a plan that could snatch the nomination away from Trump. Trump campaign attorney Bill McGinley, who was counsel to the 2012 convention s rules committee, will handle all of the campaign s legal operations at the convention.  And Brian Jack, who helped identify and elect supportive delegates at state conventions and caucuses around the country during the spring, will help gather intelligence on the delegates attending the convention to aid the whip team s efforts. It s a reality check for the grassroots organizers of an attempt to stop Trump.  While they cobble together a list of rank-and-file delegates willing to stand in Trump s way, they ll be up against an experienced and extensive operation   backed by the Republican National Committee   that will have eyes and ears on all convention activity. Trump s team is already building a database with detailed profiles of most of the delegates attending the convention and will spend the next few weeks reaching out to nearly all of them, seeking assurances of support and ensuring that any needs or concerns are heard. Members of the whip team will be assigned a group of specific delegates and will be tasked with entering information about each into the database, Jack said on the call, according to someone who listened in.  In order to beef up the database, Jack recommended whip team members place phone calls to delegates to learn about them and become  the campaign s point of contact to them,  according to the person who listened in.  Jack added that the team was going to schedule trainings  so that we can learn how best to use this database and download the information that you already know and the information you ll learn.  Anti-Trump delegates, meanwhile, have yet to compile even a complete roster of members of the convention Rules Committee, let alone the entire attendance list. Davenport told participants on the call that the whip team leaders were already going  24/7  but that they would set up operations in Cleveland on July 5, six days before delegates arrive for convention committee meetings, and remain onsite until July 21, when the convention closes. According to the person who listened in, Davenport announced that the campaign s caucus team operation, which will lead outreach to each state s delegation, will be headed by Mike Conforti and Pat Brady, both convention veterans who years ago worked at Manafort s lobbying firm. Davenport called the caucus teams  our first line of communication every morning at the delegation breakfasts,  adding that they will provide surrogates and talking points to  set the tone for the day going into the convention that evening,  according to the person who listened in. Davenport assured participants that their lodging would be funded by the campaign, though travel arrangements were still being hashed out. Davenport and Manafort did not respond to requests for comment.  But the offer to pay for travel and accommodations for members of the whip team, many of whom are not campaign staffers, is notable, given the dire financial straits facing the campaign.  It seems to suggest that Trump s team is leaving nothing to chance when it comes to securing the nomination. According to an operative on the call, there was a sense of optimism about the cohesiveness of the team after a primary season marked by campaign turmoil and infighting among loyalists to Manafort and Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as campaign manager on Monday.  Though they re taking efforts to block Trump from the nomination seriously, they view it similarly to the resistance that Ron Paul allies presented at the 2012 convention: loud but with limited influence to affect the outcome.

Trump's campaign announced in an email earlier Tuesday that it had raised more than $2 million in less than 12 hours after the presumptive Republican nominee pledged to personally match donations dollar for dollar up to $2 million.

John Lewis (center), participate in a "sit-in" to demand a vote for gun control measures.   Photo by Rep.  Chillie Pingree via APDozens of House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor Wednesday in protest of the GOP leadership s refusal to allow a vote on a gun control measure following the Orlando massacre. Led by Reps.  John Lewis (D-Ga. ), the civil rights icon, and John Larson (D-Conn. ), more than 40 Democrats walked into the chamber just before noon and pledged to  occupy  the House floor until GOP leadership allowed a vote.  In one hour, their numbers more than tripled   even as Republicans recessed the House, turning off C-SPAN cameras and the video feed to the public. Democrats countered the TV camera blackout by streaming everything on their cellphones, which ended up on C-SPAN anyway. Democrats have tried numerous times over the past week to force a vote on a  no fly, no buy  bill, which would bar terror suspects on the  no-fly  list from purchasing guns.  The sit-in represented a sharp escalation in the fight, however, putting political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) to allow a roll-call vote on the policy issue that s gotten the most traction following the Florida shooting. But by early afternoon, there were no signs that Republicans would acquiesce to the Democrats  demands for a vote.  Republicans believe that if they give in now, it would encourage more such actions by Democrats, and one GOP leadership aide called the move a  Democrat publicity stunt.  But Democrats claim they will stay on the floor as long as it takes.  They want Ryan to cancel the mid-July recess to take up their proposal.  We have been too quiet for too long,  Lewis said.   There comes a time when you have to say something.  You have to make a little noise.  You have to move your feet.  This is the time.  How many more mothers? How many more fathers need to shed tears of grief before we do something?  Lewis continued, his voice rising in intensity.   Give us a vote.  Let us vote.  We came here to do our job.  We came here to work.  A short while later, Rep.  Jerry Nadler (D-N. Y. ) said the House  is drenched in blood and the only way we can cleanse it is if the speaker of the House allows us to vote on this legislation.  Every day that we don t commit to a vote, the blood is on the leadership of this House,  Nadler said. But Rep.  Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican, slammed the sit-in, tweeting that  calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworth s.  They sat in for rights.  Dems are  sitting in  to  strip them away.

The cameras followed since, technically, the House was not in session. Democrats, including Reps.  Joe Crowley of New York, Donna Edwards of Maryland and Alcee Hastings of Florida, meanwhile, sat down on the floor or stood by the front podium.  They began reading the names of those who died in the June 12 shooting at a Florida nightclub that left 49 dead and 53 wounded.  No bill, no break,  they chanted, repeating recent demands that House GOP leaders cancel the upcoming House recess until they vote on gun control. Members took turns speaking, backed up by chants and applause.  We ve had it.  We re not going to watch any more people in this country get slaughtered and do nothing!  Rep.  Mike Doyle (D-Pa. ) yelled during the protest.  Break the shackles!  Rep.  Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said at another point. Rep.  Maxine Waters (D-Calif. ) taunted Republicans, saying they  don t have the guts to stand up to the gun lobby.  Lawmakers tweeted their protest, posting pictures online, and Rep.  Scott Peters (D-Calif. ) started streaming the sit-in live on the Periscope app. As the number of Democrats on the floor grew, staffers brought in cases of bottled water, Coca-Cola and Diet Coke to the Democratic cloakroom.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ), who led the 15-hour filibuster in the Senate last week, showed up to encourage Democrats.  His filibuster had forced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) to hold a series of votes on gun measures, though none cleared that chamber. The Democrats cheered him, vowing to sit in the chamber until they forced a vote in their own chamber, too.

Police remove Michael Steven Sandford as Donald Trump speaks at the Treasure Island hotel and casino in Las Vegas on June 18, 2016.  Sandford is accused of trying to take a police officer's gun and kill Trump during the weekend rally.   When a British man allegedly tried to snatch the weapon of a Las Vegas police officer at the site of one of Donald Trump's rallies last Saturday with the intent to kill him, the presumptive Republican nominee says he was unaware of the incident until he saw media reports. "He said in court he wanted to kill you," Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo said during a telephone interview with Trump on Wednesday morning, referring to a Secret Service agent's report filed in Nevada court on Monday.  "When did you first learn about this?"Trump responded, "Actually, I learned about it watching television.  They didn t tell me about it, and probably they re better off not telling me about it. ""But I learned about it watching television, and I can tell you this: we have tremendous Secret Service and we have tremendous police throughout this country, and I think they did a fantastic job," he continued.  "The policeman whose gun was tried to be, you know, stolen by this maniac, was really fantastic.  And so police have done a great job, and Secret Service, these people are great.  They don t get the kind of credit they deserve.  I deal with them all the time.  I see them, I watch them, I know them and they re terrific, terrific people. ""We do have protocols in place to notify the staff and/or the protectee when there is an incident," Secret Service communications director Cathy Milhoan told POLITICO.  Milhoan declined to offer further details. Asked specifically about reports that the man had overstayed his visa, Trump commented, "Well, that's what's happening.  I mean, look, we have no law, we have no order when it comes to many things.  I mean, we're just talking about immigration. ""Overstaying visas is a whole part of it," Trump said, speculating that there are "millions" of people currently overstaying their visas in the United States.

"                 Bryan Pagliano had previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.   A former computer technology aide to Hillary Clinton repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment Wednesday during a court-ordered deposition in a lawsuit related to Clinton's private email set-up, according a conservative group pressing the legal case. Tech specialist Bryan Pagliano asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination "more than 125 times" during the testimony, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in an interview. In addition to refusing to answer questions based on the Fifth Amendment, Pagliano's attorneys repeatedly stepped in to block answers to other queries they said went beyond the scope of topics allowed by U. S.  District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, Fitton said. "On many of the key issues, he took the Fifth," Fitton said.  "He took the Fifth even on questions about his resume.  They had a very narrow definition of what discovery" was permitted, the Judicial Watch official said. Asked what questions Pagliano did answer, Fitton said he believed the tech aide acknowledged that he had read documents shown him by attorneys at the deposition. Pagliano's lead attorney, Mark MacDougall, declined to comment Wednesday. Pagliano worked as a computer specialist on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, then joined the State Department while she served as secretary of state.  During that time, he was also being paid by the Clintons to maintain their private server at their home in Chappaqua, N. Y.  Those payments were not reported on Pagliano's financial disclosure at State, officials said. Fitton said that, in addition to MacDougall, three other attorneys from law firm Akin Gump representing Pagliano attended the deposition Wednesday.  The former IT aide declined to answer a question about who was paying for his legal counsel, Fitton added. Pagliano previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.  After initially declining to speak with FBI investigators, the tech specialist struck a limited immunity deal with prosecutors and spoke with investigators. Pagliano's attorneys asked that his deposition in the Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act suit not be videotaped, citing the potential for the tape to be used to embarrass him or to taint a jury in a potential criminal case.  Sullivan declined to block the videotaping, but he did order that all videos of depositions in the case be put under seal. However, the transcript of Pagliano's questioning is expected to be released as soon as Thursday. Fitton said he hopes Sullivan will view Pagliano's assertion of the Fifth Amendment as evidence that Clinton's private email setup may have been designed to evade the Freedom of Information Act.  "The judge can draw negative inferences about whether there was an effort to subvert FOIA," Fitton said. In a speech Wednesday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump again slammed Clinton over her email system, including her decision to delete about 32,000 messages her attorneys deemed personal. "While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So, they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States," Trump said.  "This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. "In response, Clinton's presidential campaign cited news stories saying logs from the server offer no indication that it was hacked. Closed-door depositions in the FOIA lawsuit are scheduled to continue next week, with testimony expected from former Clinton Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy.                  Bryan Pagliano had previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.   A former computer technology aide to Hillary Clinton repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment Wednesday during a court-ordered deposition in a lawsuit related to Clinton's private email set-up, according a conservative group pressing the legal case. Tech specialist Bryan Pagliano asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination "more than 125 times" during the testimony, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in an interview. In addition to refusing to answer questions based on the Fifth Amendment, Pagliano's attorneys repeatedly stepped in to block answers to other queries they said went beyond the scope of topics allowed by U. S.  District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, Fitton said. "On many of the key issues, he took the Fifth," Fitton said.  "He took the Fifth even on questions about his resume.  They had a very narrow definition of what discovery" was permitted, the Judicial Watch official said. Asked what questions Pagliano did answer, Fitton said he believed the tech aide acknowledged that he had read documents shown him by attorneys at the deposition. Pagliano's lead attorney, Mark MacDougall, declined to comment Wednesday. Pagliano worked as a computer specialist on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, then joined the State Department while she served as secretary of state.  During that time, he was also being paid by the Clintons to maintain their private server at their home in Chappaqua, N. Y.  Those payments were not reported on Pagliano's financial disclosure at State, officials said. Fitton said that, in addition to MacDougall, three other attorneys from law firm Akin Gump representing Pagliano attended the deposition Wednesday.  The former IT aide declined to answer a question about who was paying for his legal counsel, Fitton added. Pagliano previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.  After initially declining to speak with FBI investigators, the tech specialist struck a limited immunity deal with prosecutors and spoke with investigators. Pagliano's attorneys asked that his deposition in the Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act suit not be videotaped, citing the potential for the tape to be used to embarrass him or to taint a jury in a potential criminal case.  Sullivan declined to block the videotaping, but he did order that all videos of depositions in the case be put under seal. However, the transcript of Pagliano's questioning is expected to be released as soon as Thursday. Fitton said he hopes Sullivan will view Pagliano's assertion of the Fifth Amendment as evidence that Clinton's private email setup may have been designed to evade the Freedom of Information Act.  "The judge can draw negative inferences about whether there was an effort to subvert FOIA," Fitton said. In a speech Wednesday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump again slammed Clinton over her email system, including her decision to delete about 32,000 messages her attorneys deemed personal. "While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So, they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States," Trump said.  "This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.

Sen.  Harry Reid's support may not help bring Republicans on-board given his polarizing reputation in the GOP.    Sen.  Susan Collins' attempt to keep firearms out of the hands of potential terrorists just picked up its most powerful backer yet: Harry Reid. In an interview, the Senate minority leader said that the Maine Republican's bill to create a narrow list of people barred from buying firearms is worth supporting even if it does not go as far as Democratic-backed efforts.  He declined to say if the Democratic Caucus will get behind it, though aides have suggested as many as 40 Democrats could end up voting for the bill. "The last bill I saw, even though I don't think everything's right about it, I would vote for it," Reid said.  "I really do believe that even though it may be a small step forward, at least it's a step forward. "Reid's decision comes as a growing number of Democrats began backing Collins, from liberals like Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin to moderate Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill. ) has backed the bill, though Democratic No.  3 Chuck Schumer of New York has not yet decided.  The National Rifle Association opposes the bill, which may make it easier for Democrats to support and far more difficult for Republicans.  Reid's support may not help bring Republicans on-board either given his polarizing reputation in the GOP.  The Collins bill would merge the No-Fly list and the Selectee list   which gets more scrutiny from authorities   and block people on that merged list from purchasing guns.  People on the broader terrorism watch list would be able to purchase firearms but the FBI would be notified of their purchases.  While it's supported by a growing bipartisan coalition, the bill still faces an uphill path to 60 votes.                   Sen.

We are all in this together, and we have a responsibility to lift each other up,  Hillary Clinton said. Hillary Clinton showed no signs Wednesday of slowing her verbal onslaught on Donald Trump, using the former reality TV star s most famous words against him to present herself as the best candidate to improve America s economy. After casting Trump as an economic danger, attacking his bombastic, controversial rhetoric on America s economy and mocking his business record on Tuesday, Clinton continued driving that message while also presenting an economic plan she said would work for everyone.  Maybe we shouldn t expect better from someone whose most famous words are  You re fired,   Clinton told supporters during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, after pointing to Trump s proposals.   Well, here s what I want you to know: I do have a jobs program, and as president I m gonna make sure that you hear  You re hired.   Clinton boasted that the billionaire businessman  hates it  when anybody  points out how hollow his sales pitch really is.   And I guess my speech yesterday must have gotten under his skin because right away he lashed out on Twitter with outlandish lies and conspiracy theories, and he did the same in his speech today,  Clinton said.  Trump blasted Clinton on Wednesday morning in his long-awaited remarks about the former secretary of state, accusing her of being a  world-class liar  who  may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.   He presented his rival as another corrupt politician who s beholden to donors and special interests and blamed her leadership   or lack thereof   at the State Department for the rise of the Islamic State.  He even attacked her  old and tired  message and mocked her campaign slogan,  I m with her.   You know what my response to that is? I m with you, the American people,  Trump said to applause.   She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you.  I know it s all about making America great again for all Americans.  Though he lodged a barrage of attacks at Clinton during his speech, Trump didn t sit idly by when it was Clinton s turn.  The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted as Clinton was speaking that the choice in November is  between Americanism and her corrupt globalism    while including the hash tag #Imwithyou. Clinton suggested that Trump was attacking her personally  because he has no answers on the substance.   All he can do is try to distract us.  That s even why he s attacking my faith   sigh   and of course attacking a philanthropic foundation that saves and improves lives around the world,  Clinton said.   It s no surprise he doesn t understand these things.  The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to life-saving AIDS medicine.  Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties.  Clinton highlighted her faith just minutes into her speech, implicitly firing back at Trump, who in a video published via Twitter by Christian conservative E. W.  Jackson on Tuesday claimed that  there s nothing out there  about Clinton s faith.  (Clinton has said she is Methodist and has talked about it on multiple occasions, including on the campaign trail, and Trump later told CBS he didn t mean his remark  in a negative way ). Clinton said every child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential, calling that the cause of her life.   It's rooted in the values that I learned from my family and my faith.  We are all in this together, and we have a responsibility to lift each other up,  she added.   As we Methodists like to say,  Do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can,  and that is absolutely true for our children.  That's why I got into public service in the first place, and it's why I am determined that we will win this election in November.   Clinton reiterated her refrain that Trump has no real solutions, arguing that he spews reckless ideas that would  run up our debt and cause another economic crash.   I'm here today to offer an alternative,  she said.  And she did.  Clinton spoke of an economy that worked for everyone   one that would drive lasting growth, reduce inequality and improve upward mobility.  She advocated for a range of Democratic positions like an increase in the national minimum wage, equal pay for women, paid family leave and debt-free college and vowed not to raise taxes on the middle class and to work with Republicans to pass a comprehensive plan to create the next generation of good-paying jobs.   The measure of our success will be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, how many children are lifted out of poverty, how many Americans can find good jobs that support a middle class life and not only that, jobs that provide a sense of dignity and pride,  Clinton said.   That's what it means to have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.  That's the mission, and I'm asking all of you to join me in it.    She poked at Republicans  theory of so-called  trickle-down economics,  arguing that although it s been repeatedly proven wrong, Republicans in Congress still favor tax cuts for the wealthy.   They careen from one self-inflicted crisis to another, shutting down the government, threatening to default on our national debt, refusing to make the common sense investments that used to have broad bipartisan support, like rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, our airports or investing in better education from zero through high school and college,  Clinton said.  Republicans, she continued, have lost sight of their responsibility, adding that they allow Wall Street to take big risks and undermine workers  rights.   It's not easy to change Washington or how corporations behave.  It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan,  she said, taking another shot at Trump and his  Make America Great Again  slogan.   It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.  And that means   that means we need a president who knows what we're up against, has no illusions about what we need to do to move ahead but can actually get it done, and that is what I am offering.  Clinton said her campaign has highlighted how it will pay for the policies she has proposed.  Then she mocked Trump again. He  and I disagree on a lot of things,  she said,  and one of them is simple math.   We need to write a new chapter in the American dream and it can t be Chapter 11,  Clinton added, echoing an applause line from her speech the previous day.   So, please, join me in this campaign.  I m offering a very different vision about how we re stronger together when we grow together.  We re stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Clinton s strategy to double down on progressive ideas was wise.  Keeping the volume high on popular progressive ideas gets Clinton a two-fer, bringing Bernie Sanders supporters along for the ride while fending off Donald Trump's attempt to woo swing voters with his faux economic populism,  he said.   Campaigning as a bold progressive on issues like expanding Social Security, debt-free college, and Wall Street reform is both a smart Democratic unity strategy and a smart general election strategy.

Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina.  In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an eleventh-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant front-runner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election is too important to miss since the GOP could potentially lose the Senate majority.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn t hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so, I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a case against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American and his experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Trump, once virtually tied with Clinton, is now trailing her by 8 points in the poll.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Still, Democrats tried to see the glass as half full.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democratic voters, and Trump has been reeling.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it would make him damaged goods and potentially close off a 2020 White House bid. Rubio was characteristically confident, though.  He dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  He has no significant achievements in his entire life,  Rubio said.   He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  As for Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation and said,  The chances are, he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office.  Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He ll have to answer for that,  Rubio said. Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate term. Asked whether he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  he said. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings on June 12, when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling with fundraising and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District.  Businessman Todd Wilcox said he s staying in the race along with Beruff. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he runs for president again. Of course, it will also give him a bigger platform and media spotlight than he d have in South Florida. Lopez-Cantera disputed the talk of a secret long-term political deal between the two.  He said he actually felt guilty because he put the  burden  on Rubio to run for the seat.  This was a selfless act,  Lopez-Cantera said.   He could have started focusing on his family and their future well-being.  Rather than plotting out a Senate bid, Rubio said, he spent weekends over the past two months planning to become the defensive coach for his son s sixth-grade football team and  designing this, if I do say so myself, pretty good defense.  I was going to get to coach my son directly because he plays safety.  I was really excited about that,  Rubio added.   I know that s kind of a small thing for people outside of it.  But for me, that was a pretty big deal.  My son will never be in sixth grade again.  In contrast, there was no Senate campaign to speak of.  Only in recent days did Rubio begin reaching out to donors (he might need as much as $50 million) and his departed presidential campaign staffers to see whether they were ready to help out. Clint Reed, Iowa director for Rubio s presidential campaign, will be his campaign manager, and Rubio s longtime consultant, Todd Harris, will serve as a strategic adviser.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan could work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the contest.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio s decision moved the seat from a  likely loss to an almost certain  hold.  It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority, so it s a big development,  McConnell said.   I m just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had.    I m pretty excited about it.  But Rubio s fellow Florida senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election. Nelson said he and Rubio  get along real well,  but  I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect.  I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.  Rubio said he s keenly aware of the risks of running for reelection and losing twice in a year   especially in an unpredictable election season like this.  I understand this was going to be a difficult race whether I announced two weeks ago or two days before qualifying,  Rubio said.   It s Florida.  General election.  Very unusual top of the ticket situation for both parties.  It s going to be tough either way.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.  In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.

He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  As for Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation and said,  The chances are, he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office.  Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He ll have to answer for that,  Rubio said. Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate term. Asked whether he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  he said. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings on June 12, when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling with fundraising and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District.  Businessman Todd Wilcox said he s staying in the race along with Beruff. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he runs for president again. Of course, it will also give him a bigger platform and media spotlight than he d have in South Florida. Lopez-Cantera disputed the talk of a secret long-term political deal between the two.  He said he actually felt guilty because he put the  burden  on Rubio to run for the seat.  This was a selfless act,  Lopez-Cantera said.   He could have started focusing on his family and their future well-being.  Rather than plotting out a Senate bid, Rubio said, he spent weekends over the past two months planning to become the defensive coach for his son s sixth-grade football team and  designing this, if I do say so myself, pretty good defense.  I was going to get to coach my son directly because he plays safety.  I was really excited about that,  Rubio added.   I know that s kind of a small thing for people outside of it.  But for me, that was a pretty big deal.  My son will never be in sixth grade again.  In contrast, there was no Senate campaign to speak of.  Only in recent days did Rubio begin reaching out to donors (he might need as much as $50 million) and his departed presidential campaign staffers to see whether they were ready to help out. Clint Reed, Iowa director for Rubio s presidential campaign, will be his campaign manager, and Rubio s longtime consultant, Todd Harris, will serve as a strategic adviser.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan could work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the contest.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio s decision moved the seat from a  likely loss to an almost certain  hold.  It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority, so it s a big development,  McConnell said.   I m just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had.    I m pretty excited about it.  But Rubio s fellow Florida senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election. Nelson said he and Rubio  get along real well,  but  I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect.  I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.  Rubio said he s keenly aware of the risks of running for reelection and losing twice in a year   especially in an unpredictable election season like this.  I understand this was going to be a difficult race whether I announced two weeks ago or two days before qualifying,  Rubio said.   It s Florida.  General election.  Very unusual top of the ticket situation for both parties.  It s going to be tough either way.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.  Donald Trump, after six bruising weeks since becoming the GOP s presumptive nominee, finally punched hard at his general election opponent.  Appearing to heed the advice of top adviser Paul Manafort and others urging him to adapt the freewheeling approach from the primary into a less bombastic general election bearing, the presumptive GOP nominee stuck to the scripted speech in the teleprompter Wednesday as he laid out his most cohesive case to date against Hillary Clinton, hitting the presumptive Democratic nominee with many of the same brutal attack lines she's been directing at him.  She doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgment, to be president,  Trump said.   She believes she is entitled to the office.  Her campaign slogan is  I m with her.   You know what my response to that is?  he continued.   I m with you: the American people.   Trump threw the entire RNC opposition file at Clinton, questioning her integrity over the deleted emails from her private server, suggesting that a nexus between State Department business and her global philanthropy and lucrative private speechmaking and blaming her personally for the death of former Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others in Benghazi.  And he borrowed from a widely debunked book about the Clintons, arguing that Bill Clinton s paid speeches in China influenced his wife s decisions as Secretary of State.  She gets rich making you poor,  Trump said.   She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing.  He continued to provoke, but in a somewhat tempered and at times more presidential tone   a shift perhaps eased by the dismissal of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the combative Trump loyalist regarded as an enabler of Trump s most controversial impulses.  Long confident but carefree, Trump looked different Wednesday morning as he stood behind a lectern in his Soho hotel; he looked like a candidate serious about trying to win in November. "You can really see a difference between a Corey and a Manafort approach,  said Michael Steele, the former RNC chairman.   Corey would say  just go for it.   Manafort is telling him he has to define a narrative and stick to it; and he clearly is trying to turn some corners.  The test is can he sustain that.  The next interview he gives, can he stay on message and drive those points home?"Even with Lewandowski out of Trump s inner circle, Trump is still Trump.  And after a year of incendiary, off the cuff speeches blending schoolyard insults and conspiracy theories, donors and establishment Republicans unnerved by Trump s lack of focus are nervously eyeing Twitter and the cable TV airwaves for a knee-jerk utterance that could undercut any attempted pivot.  When the bar is low, you can exceed it,  said Ryan Williams, a GOP operative who worked on Mitt Romney s 2012 campaign.   It was the type of speech one would expect to hear from a major candidate, different from the rambling, unscripted ones he s given for the last year.  And it was the first major speech after the change in leadership within the campaign and demonstrated self-discipline and I think will give some people a little more confidence in the campaign.  But he needs to keep it up.  One speech isn't going to change people's perceptions.  Facing the prospect of self-financing his campaign to keep pace with Clinton, who has some $42 million in the bank compared to Trump's own $1. 3 million total, the presumptive GOP nominee has been intensifying his courtship of a skeptical Republican donor class, aiming to bolster his campaign and help fill RNC coffers with the party s congressional majorities hanging in the balance.  Performing more consistently on the stump, Williams said, should help.  Whoever gave him the advice to give that kind of speech was right and he was right to listen to them,  Williams said.   Is it going win him the election today? No.  But at this point he needs to rebuild confidence in his campaign.  If he's going to go out and raise money from donors, he needs to be confident in that effort.  Trump branded Clinton a  world class liar,  attacking her for supporting the Iraq war, the war in Libya and the Obama administration s decision to withdraw U. S.  troops from Iraq   all of which Trump has expressed support for.  And he continued to misrepresent reality with broad-brush statements, by asserting that the government has no vetting process for refugees seeking asylum, by claiming that Iran is the  dominant power in the Middle East  and even by mistakenly characterizing jobs that have been relocated to Mexico as having been moved  overseas.  Donald Trump's mendacity and continued disregard for detail mattered less to frantic Republicans than him simply staying on message for an hour. "He really doesn't have that high a bar,  said Curt Anderson, a GOP strategist in Washington.   It's high for him, but it's wouldn't be that high for a normal human: just be uninteresting, not inflammatory and don't screw up and he'll be in a tight race.  Most politicians, you re trying to help them be more interesting.  If Trump could just master being boring, he'd be good.  But not all GOP operatives agree that Trump is well served by reining in the rhetoric or even capable of doing so.  His reputation has been established by now,  said Liz Mair, a GOP communications consultant.   John Kerry and Mitt Romney tried to pivot, too.  It doesn t work.  You are who you are   you can t be one guy in the primaries and another in the general.  It tends to just piss off your primary backers and it doesn t play well with anyone else.

Brent Scowcroft's endorsement of Hillary Clinton comes after his fellow foreign-policy realist Richard Armitage's endorsement a week prior.   Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W.  Bush, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Wednesday. "Secretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the world s indispensable leader," Scowcroft said in a statement, touting her experience as secretary of state.  "She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous.  She appreciates that it is essential to maintain our strong military advantage, but that force must only be used as a last resort. "Clinton, Scowcroft stated, "brings deep expertise in international affairs, and a sophisticated understanding of the world," qualities he described as "essential for the Commander-in-Chief. ""Her longstanding relationships with a wide array of world leaders, and their sense of her as a strong and reliable counterpart, make her uniquely prepared for the highest office in the land," he added. Scowcroft's endorsement comes after his fellow foreign-policy realist Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state under George W.  Bush, told POLITICO last week that he would support Clinton over Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee. "I believe Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time," Scowcroft stated. Scowcroft has said little on the record about Trump's foreign policy ideas and qualifications.  But Bush, his former boss in the White House, has made no secret of his distaste for Trump.  And the Atlantic Council, of which the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security is a part, has offered pointed criticism of Trump's foreign policy prescriptions. "If Donald Trump wants to 'make America great again' on a global stage, he cannot do so without NATO," wrote Robbie Gramer, an associate director of the Scowcroft Center's Transatlantic Security Initiative, in a March 23 blog post. R.  Nicholas Burns, a board director and Clinton adviser who served as the No.  3 official in George W.  Bush's State Department, denounced Trump as "dangerous" in a late April interview.

Marco Rubio missed a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday morning   at the same time he was announcing plans to run for reelection. The first-term Republican senator, who was pilloried during his presidential run for his record of missed votes and hearings, skipped a closed hearing on security for sales of military equipment to other nations, according to attendees from both parties.

"                 Workers on the site of Donald Trump's Old Post Office project (not pictured) told POLITICO that they aren't receiving the pay rate required by law.   The Labor Department is investigating whether workers on Donald Trump s renovation of Washington, D. C.  s Old Post Office are being paid less than federal law requires. The Labor Department confirmed to POLITICO that it s looking into allegations of wage-rule violations by the Craftsmen Group, a Trump Organization subcontractor that restores windows.  And workers on the site, including one Craftsmen Group employee, told POLITICO that they and others aren t receiving pay rates mandated by law.  Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims. Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House.  Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.   When it s completed," he said, "it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. "Since the allegations involve a subcontractor, neither the Trump Organization nor the general contractor is under investigation directly and may not be legally liable.  But union activists say the complaints reflect badly on Trump.  It s yet another example of Donald Trump s relentless hypocrisy and gross mistreatment of workers,  said Josh Goldstein, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO.  The labor federation endorsed Hillary Clinton last week for president, and for months has been highly critical of Trump's campaign. Nikki Lewis, executive director of D. C.  Jobs with Justice, a coalition of labor organizations, said, "We have to make sure that Trump and any other developer who wants to do business in the District will comply with our laws and respect our employees. " D. C.  Jobs With Justice does not endorse political candidatesA spokesperson for the Trump Organization said the company was not aware of the Labor Department investigation.  "Thousands of workers have worked on the conversion of the Old Post Office to the Trump International Hotel Washington, D. C. ," said the spokesperson, who declined to be identified by name.  The spokesperson added that the project's construction manager, Lendlease, "is utilizing a sophisticated system and dedicated employees to certify that all payrolls are correct and ensure that workers are paid prevailing wages.  If any issue is raised in the future, Lendlease will investigate and resolve it expeditiously.  Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks declined further comment, noting, "The corporate team has already replied. "The Craftsmen Group declined to comment on the record.  A person who answered the phone told POLITICO "the matter has been settled," adding, "These are not public matters.  This doesn't have to do with Donald Trump.  There should be no cause for any public interest.   A spokesman for the Labor Department confirmed Tuesday that the investigation is still open. Trump does not own the Old Post Office, but rather, is leasing it from the federal government.  That makes the Old Post Office a government construction project.  Government projects are typically covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that workers be paid the so-called prevailing wage, the rates set by unions within the geographic area where the construction takes place.  That applies even when the workers are non-union.  That s true of many workers at the Old Post Office site, and all the workers POLITICO spoke to in reporting this story. Under the terms of Trump s contract with the General Services Administration   the federal government s property manager   the Trump Organization, its contractors and subcontractors are required to pay workers Davis-Bacon rates.  According to a spokesperson for GSA, that means  the Trump Organization is required to comply with Davis-Bacon and this includes subcontractors working at the project.   In addition to the Craftsmen Group worker, three other construction workers at the Old Post Office told POLITICO they were not receiving prevailing wage.  Two of them were employed by another subcontractor, Kensington Glass Arts, and shared pay stubs and detailed information about their duties.  Both workers said they weren t being paid prevailing wage because their job classifications did not match their work responsibilities.  Both said they worked as  glaziers  installing shower doors.  Lynn Taylor, business manager of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 51, confirmed that workers who install shower doors were properly classified as glaziers.  According to a sign displayed at the Trump work site, the project s glaziers should be paid at least $24. 30 an hour and possibly $27. 64, depending on the value of Kensington Glass Arts' contract.  But the two workers  pay stubs showed them receiving $13 and $16 an hour, respectively.   Everybody is complaining  about not receiving the correct wage, one of the two workers said.  The other said that he raised the matter with Kensington Glass Arts but was told he did not qualify.   They re going to do it as long as they can get away with it,  he said.  Kensington Glass Arts, whose participation in the Old Post Office renovation is not under investigation by the Labor Department, declined to comment. A search of the Labor Department's enforcement database turned up no prior wage violations by Kensington Glass Arts or the Craftsman Group.  But the department fined Kensington Glass Arts in 2011 for 15 health and safety violations.  The Labor Department has fined Craftsmen Group three times for health and safety violations   twice in 2011 and once in 2007. Should a subcontractor be found in violation of wage laws by the Labor Department or some other investigating body, the Trump Organization won t likely be on the hook legally.  The project s general contractor, Lendlease, may share some liability, and a GSA spokesperson said that if the subcontractors  alleged violations proved serious enough, the Trump organization might choose to terminate its contract with Lendlease.  Lendlease is not aware of either of these allegations," said a spokesperson who declined to be identified by name, "or of any investigation.  When raised through appropriate channels, Lendlease takes these issues very seriously. " The spokesperson added that the company's subcontractors were "required to submit weekly certified payroll reports certifying their compliance with the prevailing wage obligations in their contracts with the Trump Organization. "This would not be Lendlease's first encounter with federal wage authorities.  In March 2015, the company, along with its subcontractor, Cindell Construction Company, agreed to pay $400,000 to settle allegations that it filed false claims to the government  after lower-tier subcontractors hired by Cindell underpaid workers and failed to compensate workers properly for overtime hours despite certifying compliance on weekly certified payrolls.  In addition, Lendlease in 2012 agreed to pay $56 million in lieu of criminal prosecution after federal prosecutors charged that the company  intentionally and fraudulently billed clients, from at least 1999 to 2009, for hours that were not worked by labor foremen.  When the Trump Organization announced in January 2015 that Lendlease would be the hotel s construction manager, Trump said in a written statement that he and Lendlease  have had great success in the past  and that he was  sure the final result of Trump International Hotel at the site of the Old Post Office will be no different.

According to a spokesperson for GSA, that means  the Trump Organization is required to comply with Davis-Bacon and this includes subcontractors working at the project.   In addition to the Craftsmen Group worker, three other construction workers at the Old Post Office told POLITICO they were not receiving prevailing wage.  Two of them were employed by another subcontractor, Kensington Glass Arts, and shared pay stubs and detailed information about their duties.  Both workers said they weren t being paid prevailing wage because their job classifications did not match their work responsibilities.  Both said they worked as  glaziers  installing shower doors.  Lynn Taylor, business manager of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 51, confirmed that workers who install shower doors were properly classified as glaziers.  According to a sign displayed at the Trump work site, the project s glaziers should be paid at least $24. 30 an hour and possibly $27. 64, depending on the value of Kensington Glass Arts' contract.  But the two workers  pay stubs showed them receiving $13 and $16 an hour, respectively.   Everybody is complaining  about not receiving the correct wage, one of the two workers said.  The other said that he raised the matter with Kensington Glass Arts but was told he did not qualify.   They re going to do it as long as they can get away with it,  he said.  Kensington Glass Arts, whose participation in the Old Post Office renovation is not under investigation by the Labor Department, declined to comment. A search of the Labor Department's enforcement database turned up no prior wage violations by Kensington Glass Arts or the Craftsman Group.  But the department fined Kensington Glass Arts in 2011 for 15 health and safety violations.  The Labor Department has fined Craftsmen Group three times for health and safety violations   twice in 2011 and once in 2007. Should a subcontractor be found in violation of wage laws by the Labor Department or some other investigating body, the Trump Organization won t likely be on the hook legally.  The project s general contractor, Lendlease, may share some liability, and a GSA spokesperson said that if the subcontractors  alleged violations proved serious enough, the Trump organization might choose to terminate its contract with Lendlease.  Lendlease is not aware of either of these allegations," said a spokesperson who declined to be identified by name, "or of any investigation.  When raised through appropriate channels, Lendlease takes these issues very seriously. " The spokesperson added that the company's subcontractors were "required to submit weekly certified payroll reports certifying their compliance with the prevailing wage obligations in their contracts with the Trump Organization. "This would not be Lendlease's first encounter with federal wage authorities.  In March 2015, the company, along with its subcontractor, Cindell Construction Company, agreed to pay $400,000 to settle allegations that it filed false claims to the government  after lower-tier subcontractors hired by Cindell underpaid workers and failed to compensate workers properly for overtime hours despite certifying compliance on weekly certified payrolls.  In addition, Lendlease in 2012 agreed to pay $56 million in lieu of criminal prosecution after federal prosecutors charged that the company  intentionally and fraudulently billed clients, from at least 1999 to 2009, for hours that were not worked by labor foremen.  When the Trump Organization announced in January 2015 that Lendlease would be the hotel s construction manager, Trump said in a written statement that he and Lendlease  have had great success in the past  and that he was  sure the final result of Trump International Hotel at the site of the Old Post Office will be no different.

Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert reports to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn. , on  June 22 to begin serving a 15-month sentence in a hush money case.    The Rochester Post-Bulletin/APFormer House Speaker Dennis Hastert surrendered to authorities at a federal prison hospital in Minnesota Wednesday to begin serving a 15-month sentence related to hush money he paid to conceal sexual abuse of students while he was a high school teacher and coach more than three decades ago, a prison official said. Citing several serious health issues facing the ex-speaker, Hastert's attorneys had urged U. S.  District Court Judge Thomas Durkin not to impose any prison sentence in the case.  But at sentencing in April, the judge called Hastert's conduct "unforgivable" and sentenced him to more than double the zero-to-six months prosecutors had requested. The judge did agree to Hastert's attorneys request to recommend that the Bureau of Prisons house Hastert at the Federal Medical Center at Rochester, Minn. , so that he could be treated for effects of a stroke, spinal surgery, a blood infection and diabetes. Prosecutors said Hastert abused at least four boys at the Yorkville, Ill.  high school where he served as a wrestling coach and social studies teacher.  However, the statute of limitations on those events ran out long ago. The federal felony charge the former speaker pled guilty to last year was illegal structuring of bank withdrawals related to an agreement to pay $3. 5 million to one of the victims. After being warned by bank officials that his large cash withdrawals were being reported to federal authorities, Hastert began taking money out in increments of less than $10,000 to try to avoid those reports being issued.  Breaking up deposits or withdrawals to avoid reporting requirements is a violation of federal law. Hastert paid $1. 7 million of the promised compensation before he was confronted by the FBI early last year.  The recipient of the funds, who has not been publicly identified, is now suing the former speaker for the remainder. Durkin also ordered the ex-speaker to pay a $250,000 fine in the criminal case, which he did last month. Hastert spent more than 20 years in the House and served for eight years as speaker, making him the longest-serving Republican speaker in history.

Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a "world-class liar" who "may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. "Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her "pathetic email and server statements," Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. "When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me," Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's "rigged" against the American people. In contrast, Clinton "has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft," Trump said. "She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash," Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  "Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. ""Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001," Trump said.  "They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. "Clinton does not have the temperament, "or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office," Trump said. "Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people," Trump said to applause.  "She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. "Trump used details from "Clinton Cash," the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as "false, right-wing attacks" funded by the Koch brothers, and it continued to push back on Trump's attacks Wednesday afternoon.  The only thing Donald Trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories.  This is more distraction from a candidate that cannot answer or dispute any of yesterday s criticism of his business record," Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement.  "Economists on the left, right and center all agree his dangerous economic policies would throw us back into recession and hurt working families costing nearly 3. 5 million American jobs, that s a fact.  Donald Trump continues to prove that he is unqualified and unfit to be president.  Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  The AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Clinton, only went so far as to give Trump credit for having "recognized some of the challenges working people have known for decades," Josh Goldstein, deputy national media director said, "but the truth is he doesn t have a clue how to fix our problems, he would only make them worse. Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy "wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. ""To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server," Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. "Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger," Trump continued.  "Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. "He continued, "National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. ""Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States," Trump said.  "She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. "Trump also alleged that Clinton "managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East" as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State " threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. "Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he "was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. "However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, "yeah, I guess so" and "I wish the first time it was done correctly" when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. "But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya," Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. "Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it," he said.  " This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  "Vowing to "build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth" and ensure the military "will have the best technology and finest equipment," Trump promised "massive new factories" that will "come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. ""Construction is what I know," he said.  "I say, nobody knows it better.

"It doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee, so I'm not going to be determining the scope of the convention," Sanders said during an interview with C-SPAN.  The comment came in response to a question about his preparations for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in late July.  The comment is notable because the Vermont senator has refused to formally drop out of the Democratic presidential primary and instead has vowed to push his policy agenda at the convention.  Sanders' comments suggest that despite the fact that he's signaled he plans to use his 1,879 delegates to wring concessions from Hillary Clinton and her supporters in Philadelphia, he understands that his leverage may ultimately prove limited. Sanders said he remains determined, however, to press for reforms to the party's nominating process: above all, to change the superdelegate system that has given Clinton an unassailable advantage among elected officials and other party insiders. "They should reflect the votes of the people in their states.  We have won states with 70, 80 percent of the vote where superdelegates are going to vote for my opponent," Sanders said.  "That's not terribly democratic. " Sen.  Bernie Sanders acknowledged Wednesday that his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president aren't ideal.

An influential Republican National Committee official is rebuking his own party, accusing it of empowering anti-Donald Trump figures to play key roles at this summer s convention   and, potentially, to dislodge Trump.  In a three-page letter sent to fellow RNC members, Bruce Ash, an Arizona Republican who oversees the committee s permanent Rules Committee, laces into the organization for appointing establishment-minded figures who, he says, could overturn Trump s nomination at the convention.  Ash s letter comes amid an intensifying push by anti-Trump delegates to implement a  conscience clause  on the first ballot that would allow delegates to unbind themselves from voting for Trump   thereby freeing themselves to throw their support to a  white knight  candidate who would take the nomination instead.  Specifically, Ash points to the RNC s appointments of committee members Ron Kaufman and Enid Mickelson (both of whom are close allies of Trump nemesis Mitt Romney) to oversee the convention s Rules Committee.  He also calls out the RNC for assigning establishment stalwart Haley Barbour to run the convention s Permanent Organization Committee.  (Kaufman, Mickelson and Barbour did not immediately respond to requests for comment. )  I stand by my analysis because I have concerns about the appointees who have worked with Romney in the past and despite well intentioned assurances, might possibly work to deny Trump the nomination he has earned.  I am a member of the convention rules committee and am entitled to my opinion,  writes Ash. He adds that he finds it  quite remarkable that the RNC might actually be leaning toward a vote to essentially invoke  a rule that would  reverse the results of the primary contests and unbind our delegates.   Ash goes on to suggest that the Trump campaign cut an ill-conceived deal with the RNC in hopes of fostering a relationship with the committee.  In recent weeks, there have been tensions between the two sides.   I m sure Mr.  Trump and campaign chairman Paul Manafort agreed to the appointments because they sought reconciliation and a merger with the RNC.  If this was part of the bargain then they had to deal with it.  However, it does not mean it was smart to sign off on this arrangement unless there are boundaries how we guarantee there will not be rules changes at convention rules which affect who our presumptive nominee is in 2016 after he received nearly 14,000,000 votes.    You might not agree with my words but you surely cannot fault my desire to stand up for millions of GOP voters who cast their vote for Donald Trump,  Ash adds.  Passing any unbinding rule remains unlikely.  To do so, it must be approved by a majority of the 112-member Rules Committee and then win a majority of support among the convention s 2,472 delegates.  Neither Ash nor an RNC spokesperson responded to a request for comment.  The Arizona Republican concludes the letter by writing:  We at the RNC must stand by our presumptive nominee s side and defend against all who would threaten our legitimacy as a national party.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. ) will join Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail Monday in Cincinnati, the presumptive Democratic nominee's campaign announced Wednesday. "At a public event in Cincinnati, Clinton and Warren will discuss their shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," the campaign said in its announcement. Warren has been an outspoken surrogate for Clinton, and is reported to be on the former secretary of state's shortlist for vice presidential candidates.

This event will complete one of the biggest sellouts in political history given that Hillary Clinton is everything Elizabeth Warren supposedly stands against," Short said.

"Watching Elizabeth Warren defend Hillary Clinton s refusal to turn over her Wall Street speech transcripts will be as priceless as the accounts of her attending fundraisers with the same hedge-fund managers she built a career demonizing.                   Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas on June 18.   Donald Trump launched a new allegation at Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, accusing her of having "laundered" money through a for-profit university while she was secretary of state. In a rapid-response email blast sent during Clinton s speech attacking Trump s economic proposals, the billionaire s campaign accused the former secretary of state of funneling government money to Laureate Education, a for-profit chain of universities that employed Bill Clinton as honorary chancellor until April 2015. The former president made $16. 5 million over his five years in that position while his wife added Laureate to the State Department Global Partnership.  Trump alleges the Department of State awarded $55. 2 million in grants to Laureate, an accusation that is not quite accurate since there is no indication that State Department money flowed directly to the for-profit education chain.  According to Bloomberg, the $55. 2 million in State Department and USAID grant money actually went to the International Youth Foundation, a non-profit group headed by Laurate Education Chairman Douglas Becker. That same Bloomberg investigation showed that the IYF received $9 million in State Department grants in 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate.  The number jumped to $15. 1 million in 2010, Bill Clinton's first year with Laureate, and ballooned to $25. 5 million in grants in 2012.  This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle,  Trump s email read.   Laureate made money by racking up student debt on vulnerable students.  Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by pointing to IYF's history of working with the State Department and USAID that dates back to the George W.  Bush administration. "This is yet another false allegation from Donald Trump," Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.  "The International Youth Foundation was funded by the Bush administration, well before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.  In fact, the non-profit's USAID funding actually went down in the year that she arrived at the State Department, not up. "International Youth Foundation CEO and President Bill Reese dismissed as  totally erroneous  and  ridiculous  the suggestion by Trump or anybody else that the foundation had been the beneficiary of political quid-pro-quo.  He said all of the foundation s grants have been won competitively and that the non-profit goes through rigorous, government-mandated audit processes that would have caught any money being steered from IYF back to Laureate.  If there was government money going back to a private company, let alone a board member s company, my God it would all have to be reported,  Reese said.   Or we d be in violation of OMB regulations, of IRS regulations, of normal auditing practice by non-profits.  It s just, it s crazy.  Reese said the uptick in government money beginning in 2010 came from grants awarded during both the Obama and Bush administrations that paid out over the course of several years and had no correlation to Bill Clinton s position with Laureate. Reese also conceded that Becker does sit on the IYF s board of directors but said the Laureate chairman is just one of many high-profile board members, including the CEO and President of Hilton Worldwide and a former senior vice president of Saudi Arabia s national oil and gas company, Saudi Aramco.   It would be laughable,  Reese said of Trump s accusation.   But it s no laughing matter to be accused of things that of course have no factual basis.  While Trump s specific allegation of money laundering is new, accusations of an improper relationship between the Clintons, State Department, and Laureate are not.  The connections between the three were originally published in the 2015 book  Clinton Cash  by Peter Schweizer and reported on by Bloomberg and Inside Higher Education.  At the time, Laureate denied the accusations, and said that IYF was "an independent non-profit organization; not an affiliate of Laureate. "Trump contrasted Clinton s troubled ties to Laureate Education with his own Trump University, where the email said the candidate  has created an incredible learning experience for students.   Like Trump University, Laureate was the subject of a fraud lawsuit, although that case was later dismissed.

House Speaker Paul Ryan was drowned out by the chants of House Democrats on the chamber's floor.   After a chaotic, daylong occupation of the House floor, Republican leaders moved in the wee hours of the night to cut off House Democrats' gun control "sit-in" by adjourning the House through the July 4 recess   without a gun vote. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) intends to quell the demonstration by having lawmakers vote at 2:30 a. m.  on several bills they had to pass this week, including one to combat the Zika virus.  After that, Republicans will send lawmakers home until July 5, starting their already-scheduled recess a few days earlier than planned. The move will deny Democrats any chance of votes on gun control legislation. Democrats will have to decide whether to continue their sit-in after the House adjourns.  Senior Democratic lawmakers had said the protest would continue through Thursday and Friday, but it's unclear how the sudden change in schedule will affect those plans.  Leadership's move came 15 hours after Democrats seized the House floor, vowing to block any House legislative action until Ryan promised to allow a roll call on what they believe is a reasonable proposal: blocking suspected terrorists on the no-fly list from purchasing guns. Ryan refused.  And Democrats said they were willing to hold the floor hostage all night and into Thursday and even Friday.  "I couldn't predict" how long it will go on, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md. ) told reporters around 10 p. m.  "I mean tomorrow, and the next day. . .  You've seen folks in the (House) gallery; they're pretty fired up on this.  It could go through Friday. "Republicans used a parliamentary maneuver after midnight to try to short-circuit the Democratic sit-in.  They rushed through debate on a funding bill to combat the Zika virus, as well as a measure to fund military construction and the Veterans Affairs department, setting up final votes on both measures for 2:30 a. m.  The chaotic day started around noon when Democrats took the chamber.  Republicans almost immediately recessed the House and turned off the chamber video cameras.  But that only drew more attention to the "sit-in," as lawmakers whipped out their phones and started streaming their efforts online, which was in turn broadcast by C-SPAN.  The protest soon became the story of the day, leading news websites across the nation. House leadership earlier in the day suggested they weren't interested in bringing security in to escort Democrats out, but they also weren't willing to give them the votes they wanted. If Ryan thought a few hours on the House floor would assuage the left, he was mistaken.  He entered the chamber at 10 p. m.  to break up the protest by moving to a vote on unrelated legislation to override an Obama administration rule.  But as he sought to restore order in the chamber, Democrats chanted "No bill, no break!"   a reference to the upcoming July recess they want to postpone until a vote on gun control is held. Earlier Wednesday, Ryan called the protest "nothing more than a publicity stunt," noting that the bill at issue was recently defeated in the Senate.  "We're not going to take away a citizen's constitutional rights without due process," the speaker told CNN. Ryan and other Republicans say that relenting to Democrats' demand would only encourage more protests and distort the majority party's prerogative to decide which bills reach the floor, a bad precedent for the House in general. The clash on the floor during the vote on the unrelated bill was ugly, a scene even longtime Hill observers have said they've never witnessed before.  Democrats who had been in the chamber all day for the protest moaned when the House stenographer came back into the chamber to take her spot, in preparation for the vote.  Several dozen Democrats sat in front of the House podium to fill the area where members occasionally cast votes. A few minutes before the vote started, as Ryan took to the podium and slammed his wooden gavel, Democrats started chanting.  Guests watching from the gallery inside joined in, pumped their fists in the air and clapping.  A few Republicans, entering the chamber for the vote, stood for several moments to take in the surreal scene.  Lawmakers held up signs with the names of victims of gun violence, creating a sea of stark white papers with bold black letters waiving on the House floor.  Other members held pictures of victims and signs that said  Disarm Hate  printed on a rainbow background. Just before the vote, Rep.  Gwen Moore (D-Wis. ) recited a poem on the floor about gun violence. Ryan tried to speak over the crowd to call the vote, but no one in the chamber could hear him.  Police quieted the public sitting in the gallery, in accordance with House rules that bar observers from cheering, but Democratic shouts still drowned out Ryan. Despite the inability to hear, he called the vote.  And Republicans started voting. Democrats were voting using paper cards   as opposed to the electronic vote House members normally employ   in an attempt to slow down the vote. Republicans mostly kept to their side of the room, some standing to watch while others sat and chatted among themselves. Throughout the vote, Democrats crowded the well, chanting and holding up the names of gun violence victims.  Give them a vote,  Democrats shouted, shaking their papers with victims  names. Earlier, as Ryan stepped off the dais at the beginning of the vote, Democrats booed the speaker and shouted "shame! shame! shame!" at him. And Democrats at one point during the same series sang "We Shall Overcome," echoing a crowd that sang the civil rights hymn hours earlier outside the Capitol. After the vote, several Democrats went outside the House to greet a crowd that had gathered during the day to support them.  Others stayed inside the gallery to continue blasting their GOP colleagues' unwillingness to do anything about what they believe is a major gun epidemic. Rep.  Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) walked over to the area Democrats were sitting and started lecturing them that the Orlando shooting was caused by "radical Islam"   and was not an issue of guns.  Gohmert and Rep.  Corrine Brown (D-Fla. ) got into a shouting match.  Lawmakers had to break them up, and House guards with the Sergeant at Arms took to the floor to ready for any more trouble.  Up in the visitors gallery, where onlookers had gathered to support Democrats in their protest, Capitol Police started escorting out some viewers they said had shouted at House Republicans during the vote.  That goes against House rules, which require viewers be silent and not disrupt the floor. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra and Rep.  Maxine Waters, both California Democrats, ran up the stairs to play mediator, eventually convincing security to allow their supporters to stay.

Maxine Waters, both California Democrats, ran up the stairs to play mediator, eventually convincing security to allow their supporters to stay.  While Hillary Clinton was rallying with House Democrats at a high-profile meeting Wednesday morning in the Capitol Hill basement, one senior lawmaker was missing.  Connecticut Rep.  John Larson skipped the rare session with his party s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian.  Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the House? Larson was told that it was an  unprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be.   It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House, which is exactly what happened.  As Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition, Larson and Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. )   with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats   wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando.  And Wednesday s protest was nothing if not dramatic   an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue.  Longtime House watchers hadn t seen anything quite like it in many years, if at all.  If Republicans stuck together, Democrats would never be able to move their favored proposals, including blocking gun purchases by anyone on the federal  no fly  list, and expanded background checks for gun sales.  So Larson and Lewis and a handful of their colleagues decided to copy a GOP tactic from when Republicans were in the minority in 2008: Get dozens of members to go on the floor and refuse to leave.  Demand action or say they won t let the House adjourn in mid-July.  Block the House from any business until Republicans give in.  Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican leaders could either yield and allow a vote   extremely unlikely   or House Democrats would bring new attention to the issue.  It was the GOP tactic on steroids, this time in the era of widespread social media.  And the passion of Democrats on guns far exceeded that of Republicans eight years ago, when the GOP was demanding more offshore oil drilling.  The plan was laid out at a Tuesday night meeting with Larson and about a dozen Democrats.  They met in the office of Rep.  Katherine Clark of Massachusetts to hash out a plan to force a vote on the matter.  The lawmakers decided they were ready to play hardball   even if it meant shutting down their half of Congress for an entire day, or longer.   Most of the members didn t even know what was going ahead for us,  Lewis told C-SPAN.   We never said anything or shared anything.   When Lewis and Larson led their band of roughly two dozen Democrats onto the floor Wednesday to begin their sit-in, they staged the equivalent of the Senate s filibuster.  What began as an intricate behind-the-scenes plot with a handful of members grew to include almost the entire 188-person Democratic Caucus.  Releasing their pent-up anger over the nation s gun laws after the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, they took over the House floor for hours, plopping down and shutting down all legislative business until GOP leadership would allow a vote.   We said at the beginning of this week that we would use every tool in our toolbox,  Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ) said.   We said some of those tools involved hammers.  Some of those tools involved screwdrivers.  Some are blunt, some not.  We re going to keep using every single tool.   Hill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings.  In the Senate, Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes.  Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine).  House Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days.  There had been talk about trying a discharge petition   doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote   but they didn t have the support and it would take too long.  So they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy.  On Sunday, Pelosi called Israel, her caucus  top messager, and asked him to come up with a list of ways they could force the issue in the House before the chamber left for its July 4 recess.  They spoke again later that day with representatives from roughly 100 gun-control advocacy groups to discuss other options, coming up with the  No Bill, No Break  mantra that House Democrats would start chanting on the floor Tuesday when Republicans refused to recognize Rep.  Jim Clyburn (D-S. C. ) for a vote.  Israel came up with a list of options that Pelosi floated to the fuller Democratic Caucus on a conference call Monday, including asking for a vote in a motion to recommit.  The Democratic plan was to keep trying anything they could and keep causing a scene in hopes of increasing pressure on Republicans to let members go on record in a roll-call vote.  Separately, a small group of rank-and-file Democrats was plotting on its own.  Just before the week s first series of votes Tuesday evening, as lawmakers were flying back to Washington from their districts, Clark hosted a meeting in her office to brainstorm ways to force a vote.                              Rep.  Suzanne Bonamici via APLarson, whose Connecticut district is near the Sandy Hook elementary school where 20 children were shot to death in 2012, helped drive the conversation.  About 12 to 15 people showed, a source present said, including Rep.  Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn. )  We wanted to make sure the House couldn t proceed until we got a vote,  said one Democratic source.  Democratic leaders caught wind of the meeting and approved the plan but gave one bit of advice: Go big.  If you pursue such an overt demonstration, leaders said, according to one Democratic leader,  seize the opportunity  and make sure it succeeded by tapping a big name to lead the protest.  The group s choice for leader was an easy one: Civil rights leader John Lewis, who decades ago protested racial inequality during his own sit-ins in the South.  Clark and Larson asked him to take the lead.  Lewis accepted, later holding another meeting in his office Tuesday night to finalize their plans.  Some were a bit concerned about the timing.  One Democratic aide told Politico he was worried that the sit-in happening on the day that Clinton came to Capitol Hill would look staged and coordinated, when the effort began organically among rank-and-file lawmakers.  But with the House scheduled to adjourn on Friday for recess, it was now or never.  On Wednesday, just before Clinton arrived to meet with Democrats and as Larson went to speak to the parliamentarian, Pelosi stood up at a conference meeting to rally the troops.   Many of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow.  These moments of silence have almost become a moment of denial because it s a denial of what we need to do,  Pelosi said.   Now, many of you have said, we want to be disruptive, we want to be dilatory, we want to make sure the public knows that there is an opportunity to get this done.  This isn t about politics, it s not about elections, it s not about campaigns.  It s much bigger than that.   John Bresnahan contributed to this report.

Just before the week s first series of votes Tuesday evening, as lawmakers were flying back to Washington from their districts, Clark hosted a meeting in her office to brainstorm ways to force a vote.                              Rep.  Suzanne Bonamici via APLarson, whose Connecticut district is near the Sandy Hook elementary school where 20 children were shot to death in 2012, helped drive the conversation.  About 12 to 15 people showed, a source present said, including Rep.  Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn. )  We wanted to make sure the House couldn t proceed until we got a vote,  said one Democratic source.  Democratic leaders caught wind of the meeting and approved the plan but gave one bit of advice: Go big.  If you pursue such an overt demonstration, leaders said, according to one Democratic leader,  seize the opportunity  and make sure it succeeded by tapping a big name to lead the protest.  The group s choice for leader was an easy one: Civil rights leader John Lewis, who decades ago protested racial inequality during his own sit-ins in the South.  Clark and Larson asked him to take the lead.  Lewis accepted, later holding another meeting in his office Tuesday night to finalize their plans.  Some were a bit concerned about the timing.  One Democratic aide told Politico he was worried that the sit-in happening on the day that Clinton came to Capitol Hill would look staged and coordinated, when the effort began organically among rank-and-file lawmakers.  But with the House scheduled to adjourn on Friday for recess, it was now or never.  On Wednesday, just before Clinton arrived to meet with Democrats and as Larson went to speak to the parliamentarian, Pelosi stood up at a conference meeting to rally the troops.   Many of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow.  These moments of silence have almost become a moment of denial because it s a denial of what we need to do,  Pelosi said.   Now, many of you have said, we want to be disruptive, we want to be dilatory, we want to make sure the public knows that there is an opportunity to get this done.  This isn t about politics, it s not about elections, it s not about campaigns.  It s much bigger than that.   John Bresnahan contributed to this report.   While Hillary Clinton was rallying with House Democrats at a high-profile meeting Wednesday morning in the Capitol Hill basement, one senior lawmaker was missing.  Connecticut Rep.  John Larson skipped the rare session with his party s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian.  Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the House? Larson was told that it was an  unprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be.   It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House, which is exactly what happened.  As Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition, Larson and Rep.  John Lewis (D-Ga. )   with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats   wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando.  And Wednesday s protest was nothing if not dramatic   an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue.  Longtime House watchers hadn t seen anything quite like it in many years, if at all.  If Republicans stuck together, Democrats would never be able to move their favored proposals, including blocking gun purchases by anyone on the federal  no fly  list, and expanded background checks for gun sales.  So Larson and Lewis and a handful of their colleagues decided to copy a GOP tactic from when Republicans were in the minority in 2008: Get dozens of members to go on the floor and refuse to leave.  Demand action or say they won t let the House adjourn in mid-July.  Block the House from any business until Republicans give in.  Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican leaders could either yield and allow a vote   extremely unlikely   or House Democrats would bring new attention to the issue.  It was the GOP tactic on steroids, this time in the era of widespread social media.  And the passion of Democrats on guns far exceeded that of Republicans eight years ago, when the GOP was demanding more offshore oil drilling.  The plan was laid out at a Tuesday night meeting with Larson and about a dozen Democrats.  They met in the office of Rep.  Katherine Clark of Massachusetts to hash out a plan to force a vote on the matter.  The lawmakers decided they were ready to play hardball   even if it meant shutting down their half of Congress for an entire day, or longer.   Most of the members didn t even know what was going ahead for us,  Lewis told C-SPAN.   We never said anything or shared anything.   When Lewis and Larson led their band of roughly two dozen Democrats onto the floor Wednesday to begin their sit-in, they staged the equivalent of the Senate s filibuster.  What began as an intricate behind-the-scenes plot with a handful of members grew to include almost the entire 188-person Democratic Caucus.  Releasing their pent-up anger over the nation s gun laws after the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, they took over the House floor for hours, plopping down and shutting down all legislative business until GOP leadership would allow a vote.   We said at the beginning of this week that we would use every tool in our toolbox,  Rep.  Steve Israel (D-N. Y. ) said.   We said some of those tools involved hammers.  Some of those tools involved screwdrivers.  Some are blunt, some not.  We re going to keep using every single tool.   Hill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings.  In the Senate, Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes.  Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine).  House Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days.  There had been talk about trying a discharge petition   doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote   but they didn t have the support and it would take too long.  So they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy.  On Sunday, Pelosi called Israel, her caucus  top messager, and asked him to come up with a list of ways they could force the issue in the House before the chamber left for its July 4 recess.  They spoke again later that day with representatives from roughly 100 gun-control advocacy groups to discuss other options, coming up with the  No Bill, No Break  mantra that House Democrats would start chanting on the floor Tuesday when Republicans refused to recognize Rep.  Jim Clyburn (D-S. C. ) for a vote.  Israel came up with a list of options that Pelosi floated to the fuller Democratic Caucus on a conference call Monday, including asking for a vote in a motion to recommit.

Donald Trump s campaign is preparing a sophisticated operation to fight back against resurgent plans by recalcitrant conservatives to deny him the nomination at next month s Republican National Convention. In a Tuesday night conference call led partly by Trump s top adviser Paul Manafort and including 200 staffers and volunteers, Trump s senior convention aides sketched out a whip operation led by a half-dozen operatives with deep convention experience.  The effort will rely on a team of 150 volunteers and paid staff to keep the convention s 2,472 delegates in line, and it will utilize a database with information on many of the delegates. The plans laid out during the call suggest that Trump s campaign is working to reverse a narrative that it has lacked organization, and the planning also indicates that Trump s aides are taking seriously efforts by his GOP opponents to out-maneuver him on the convention floor. The campaign is planning to reveal an additional eight  regional whip  leaders in the coming days, sources familiar with the operation said.  Each will oversee seven of the 56 states and territories sending delegations to Cleveland. The team will be overseen primarily by Doug Davenport, a former lobbying associate of Manafort, who was brought on board by the Trump campaign in April to court supportive delegates. Mike McSherry, a veteran Republican operative and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, will handle operations pertaining to three crucial convention committees.  That includes the rules committee, where hardcore Trump resisters intend to force a vote on a plan that could snatch the nomination away from Trump. Trump campaign attorney Bill McGinley, who was counsel to the 2012 convention s rules committee, will handle all of the campaign s legal operations at the convention.  And Brian Jack, who helped identify and elect supportive delegates at state conventions and caucuses around the country during the spring, will help gather intelligence on the delegates attending the convention to aid the whip team s efforts. It s a reality check for the grassroots organizers of an attempt to stop Trump.  While they cobble together a list of rank-and-file delegates willing to stand in Trump s way, they ll be up against an experienced and extensive operation   backed by the Republican National Committee   that will have eyes and ears on all convention activity. Trump s team is already building a database with detailed profiles of most of the delegates attending the convention and will spend the next few weeks reaching out to nearly all of them, seeking assurances of support and ensuring that any needs or concerns are heard. Members of the whip team will be assigned a group of specific delegates and will be tasked with entering information about each into the database, Jack said on the call, according to someone who listened in.  In order to beef up the database, Jack recommended whip team members place phone calls to delegates to learn about them and become  the campaign s point of contact to them,  according to the person who listened in.  Jack added that the team was going to schedule trainings  so that we can learn how best to use this database and download the information that you already know and the information you ll learn.  Anti-Trump delegates, meanwhile, have yet to compile even a complete roster of members of the convention Rules Committee, let alone the entire attendance list. Davenport told participants on the call that the whip team leaders were already going  24/7  but that they would set up operations in Cleveland on July 5, six days before delegates arrive for convention committee meetings, and remain onsite until July 21, when the convention closes. According to the person who listened in, Davenport announced that the campaign s caucus team operation, which will lead outreach to each state s delegation, will be headed by Mike Conforti and Pat Brady, both convention veterans who years ago worked at Manafort s lobbying firm. Davenport called the caucus teams  our first line of communication every morning at the delegation breakfasts,  adding that they will provide surrogates and talking points to  set the tone for the day going into the convention that evening,  according to the person who listened in. Davenport assured participants that their lodging would be funded by the campaign, though travel arrangements were still being hashed out. Davenport and Manafort did not respond to requests for comment.  But the offer to pay for travel and accommodations for members of the whip team, many of whom are not campaign staffers, is notable, given the dire financial straits facing the campaign.  It seems to suggest that Trump s team is leaving nothing to chance when it comes to securing the nomination. According to an operative on the call, there was a sense of optimism about the cohesiveness of the team after a primary season marked by campaign turmoil and infighting among loyalists to Manafort and Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as campaign manager on Monday.  Though they re taking efforts to block Trump from the nomination seriously, they view it similarly to the resistance that Ron Paul allies presented at the 2012 convention: loud but with limited influence to affect the outcome.

Workers on the site of Donald Trump's Old Post Office project (not pictured) told POLITICO that they aren't receiving the pay rate required by law.   The Labor Department is investigating whether workers on Donald Trump s renovation of Washington, D. C.  s Old Post Office are being paid less than federal law requires. The Labor Department confirmed to POLITICO that it s looking into allegations of wage-rule violations by the Craftsmen Group, a Trump Organization subcontractor that restores windows.  And workers on the site, including one Craftsmen Group employee, told POLITICO that they and others aren t receiving pay rates mandated by law.  Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims. Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House.  Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.   When it s completed," he said, "it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. "Since the allegations involve a subcontractor, neither the Trump Organization nor the general contractor is under investigation directly and may not be legally liable.  But union activists say the complaints reflect badly on Trump.  It s yet another example of Donald Trump s relentless hypocrisy and gross mistreatment of workers,  said Josh Goldstein, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO.  The labor federation endorsed Hillary Clinton last week for president, and for months has been highly critical of Trump's campaign. Nikki Lewis, executive director of D. C.  Jobs with Justice, a coalition of labor organizations, said, "We have to make sure that Trump and any other developer who wants to do business in the District will comply with our laws and respect our employees. " D. C.  Jobs With Justice does not endorse political candidatesA spokesperson for the Trump Organization said the company was not aware of the Labor Department investigation.  "Thousands of workers have worked on the conversion of the Old Post Office to the Trump International Hotel Washington, D. C. ," said the spokesperson, who declined to be identified by name.  The spokesperson added that the project's construction manager, Lendlease, "is utilizing a sophisticated system and dedicated employees to certify that all payrolls are correct and ensure that workers are paid prevailing wages.  If any issue is raised in the future, Lendlease will investigate and resolve it expeditiously.  Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks declined further comment, noting, "The corporate team has already replied. "The Craftsmen Group declined to comment on the record.  A person who answered the phone told POLITICO "the matter has been settled," adding, "These are not public matters.  This doesn't have to do with Donald Trump.  There should be no cause for any public interest.   A spokesman for the Labor Department confirmed Tuesday that the investigation is still open. Trump does not own the Old Post Office, but rather, is leasing it from the federal government.  That makes the Old Post Office a government construction project.  Government projects are typically covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that workers be paid the so-called prevailing wage, the rates set by unions within the geographic area where the construction takes place.  That applies even when the workers are non-union.  That s true of many workers at the Old Post Office site, and all the workers POLITICO spoke to in reporting this story. Under the terms of Trump s contract with the General Services Administration   the federal government s property manager   the Trump Organization, its contractors and subcontractors are required to pay workers Davis-Bacon rates.  According to a spokesperson for GSA, that means  the Trump Organization is required to comply with Davis-Bacon and this includes subcontractors working at the project.   In addition to the Craftsmen Group worker, three other construction workers at the Old Post Office told POLITICO they were not receiving prevailing wage.  Two of them were employed by another subcontractor, Kensington Glass Arts, and shared pay stubs and detailed information about their duties.  Both workers said they weren t being paid prevailing wage because their job classifications did not match their work responsibilities.  Both said they worked as  glaziers  installing shower doors.  Lynn Taylor, business manager of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 51, confirmed that workers who install shower doors were properly classified as glaziers.  According to a sign displayed at the Trump work site, the project s glaziers should be paid at least $24. 30 an hour and possibly $27. 64, depending on the value of Kensington Glass Arts' contract.  But the two workers  pay stubs showed them receiving $13 and $16 an hour, respectively.   Everybody is complaining  about not receiving the correct wage, one of the two workers said.  The other said that he raised the matter with Kensington Glass Arts but was told he did not qualify.   They re going to do it as long as they can get away with it,  he said.  Kensington Glass Arts, whose participation in the Old Post Office renovation is not under investigation by the Labor Department, declined to comment. A search of the Labor Department's enforcement database turned up no prior wage violations by Kensington Glass Arts or the Craftsman Group.  But the department fined Kensington Glass Arts in 2011 for 15 health and safety violations.  The Labor Department has fined Craftsmen Group three times for health and safety violations   twice in 2011 and once in 2007. Should a subcontractor be found in violation of wage laws by the Labor Department or some other investigating body, the Trump Organization won t likely be on the hook legally.  The project s general contractor, Lendlease, may share some liability, and a GSA spokesperson said that if the subcontractors  alleged violations proved serious enough, the Trump organization might choose to terminate its contract with Lendlease.  Lendlease is not aware of either of these allegations," said a spokesperson who declined to be identified by name, "or of any investigation.  When raised through appropriate channels, Lendlease takes these issues very seriously. " The spokesperson added that the company's subcontractors were "required to submit weekly certified payroll reports certifying their compliance with the prevailing wage obligations in their contracts with the Trump Organization. "This would not be Lendlease's first encounter with federal wage authorities.  In March 2015, the company, along with its subcontractor, Cindell Construction Company, agreed to pay $400,000 to settle allegations that it filed false claims to the government  after lower-tier subcontractors hired by Cindell underpaid workers and failed to compensate workers properly for overtime hours despite certifying compliance on weekly certified payrolls.  In addition, Lendlease in 2012 agreed to pay $56 million in lieu of criminal prosecution after federal prosecutors charged that the company  intentionally and fraudulently billed clients, from at least 1999 to 2009, for hours that were not worked by labor foremen.  When the Trump Organization announced in January 2015 that Lendlease would be the hotel s construction manager, Trump said in a written statement that he and Lendlease  have had great success in the past  and that he was  sure the final result of Trump International Hotel at the site of the Old Post Office will be no different.

Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.                  Rep.  Chaka Fattah walks after leaving the federal courthouse in Philadelphia on  June 21  Convicted Democratic Rep.  Chaka Fattah submitted his letter of resignation from Congress Wednesday and said he wants to remain in the House until Oct.  3   the day before he is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court.  But now he appears to be having second thoughts. Fattah's initial stated desire to remain in Congress for months after he was found guilty on multiple counts of corruption stunned senior lawmakers in both parties, some of whom threatened to expel him.  Speaker Paul Ryan called on Fattah to resign immediately. "Mr.  Fattah has betrayed the trust of this institution and the people of Pennsylvania, and for that he should resign immediately from the House of Representatives," Ryan (R-Wis. ) said in a statement.  "We must hold members to the highest ethical standard, and I hope that Democratic leaders will join me in seeking his immediate resignation.  Following Ryan's statement   and facing the real possibility of expulsion   Fattah issued another statement signaling he was willing to step down sooner. "With that said, in further consultation with House Leadership, we are working to identify an agreeable time frame which will relieve the House of any distractions in carrying out the people s business," Fattah said.  "I hold the institution of the Congress of the United States in the highest regard and am thankful for the privilege to have served. "Fattah was convicted Tuesday on an array of federal corruption charges, including bribery.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct.  4.  The Pennsylvania Democrat is not allowed to vote on the floor or in committee.  After losing his April primary, following his indictment nine months earlier, Fattah was going to retire in January anyway.  Some Republicans have openly called for Fattah to resign or be expelled.  Democrats, for their part, assumed Fattah would quickly decide to leave on his own accord and most kept quiet about the issue. In a letter Wednesday to Ryan, Fattah initially declared that he would leave office, but not until Oct.  3, prior to his sentencing. "Despite my resignation, I am working to clear my name of these charges and plan to mount an appeal," Fattah said. Fattah also mentioned some of the major pieces of legislation he helped craft during his nearly 22-year career. Fattah, 59, had been charged with bribery, racketeering, money laundering, bank fraud, mail and wire fraud, and filing false statements as part of a years-long criminal scheme that even included Fattah lobbying President Barack Obama for an appointment for one of his co-conspirators.  Fattah was found guilty on all charges, as were four co-defendants.                  On the issue of NATO, Donald Rumsfeld suggested that the media hasn t accurately portrayed Donald Trump s position on the institution. Donald Rumsfeld, George W.  Bush s first defense secretary, said he  can t imagine  not voting for Donald Trump in November. Rumsfeld, speaking to Fox News  Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday night, said he is  clearly  going to vote for Trump before going on to list reasons for which he couldn t vote for Hillary Clinton. Clinton s opponent in the Democratic primary, Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders, has some things in common with Trump, Rumsfeld remarked.  There is something happening that those two people could draw 25,000 human beings to hear them speak and I think that we ought to give some credence to that and understand that that s real,  he said. On the issue of NATO, Rumsfeld suggested that the media hasn t accurately portrayed Trump s position on the institution.  I had a staff person go back and tell me precisely what Trump did say about NATO and then I compared it with what the media and his opponents are saying he said about NATIO and there s a difference,  he said. Van Susteren also asked Rumsfeld about which candidate would be better at taking down ISIL.  I think the idea of four more years of what we ve had over the past seven or eight is not going to do it,  he said. Other Republican foreign-policy heavyweights have been silent about   if not outright hostile toward   Trump, and few have endorsed him.  Earlier on Wednesday, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton, praising her  deep expertise in international affairs, and a sophisticated understanding of the world.                   The RNC bragged that Donald Trump has raised $5 million in less than 48 hours.   Combined with a joint fundraising committee established with the Republican National Committee, Donald Trump has raised more than $5 million online since Tuesday morning, according to a tweet from a top Republican official. #BREAKING Since Tuesday morning the @realDonaldTrump campaign and the JFC have raised over 5 million online  Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) June 22, 2016Under the agreement reached last month between the Trump campaign and the RNC, Trump is able to raise money directly for nearly a dozen state parties and the national committee through the Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again committees, respectively.  Individual donors can contribute nearly $450,000 each. Trump's campaign announced in an email earlier Tuesday that it had raised more than $2 million in less than 12 hours after the presumptive Republican nominee pledged to personally match donations dollar for dollar up to $2 million. "Yesterday my father sent his first ever fundraising email for the campaign and predicted it would shatter fundraising records.  Once again, my father was right," Donald Trump Jr.  wrote in the fundraising appeal. The announcements come amid great concern in the GOP about Trump's slow fundraising start.  His most recent Federal Election Commission filing showed him with just $1. 3 million in his campaign account as of June 1.                  Sen.  Harry Reid's support may not help bring Republicans on-board given his polarizing reputation in the GOP.    Sen.  Susan Collins' attempt to keep firearms out of the hands of potential terrorists just picked up its most powerful backer yet: Harry Reid. In an interview, the Senate minority leader said that the Maine Republican's bill to create a narrow list of people barred from buying firearms is worth supporting even if it does not go as far as Democratic-backed efforts.  He declined to say if the Democratic Caucus will get behind it, though aides have suggested as many as 40 Democrats could end up voting for the bill. "The last bill I saw, even though I don't think everything's right about it, I would vote for it," Reid said.  "I really do believe that even though it may be a small step forward, at least it's a step forward. "Reid's decision comes as a growing number of Democrats began backing Collins, from liberals like Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin to moderate Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill. ) has backed the bill, though Democratic No.  3 Chuck Schumer of New York has not yet decided.  The National Rifle Association opposes the bill, which may make it easier for Democrats to support and far more difficult for Republicans.  Reid's support may not help bring Republicans on-board either given his polarizing reputation in the GOP.  The Collins bill would merge the No-Fly list and the Selectee list   which gets more scrutiny from authorities   and block people on that merged list from purchasing guns.  People on the broader terrorism watch list would be able to purchase firearms but the FBI would be notified of their purchases.  While it's supported by a growing bipartisan coalition, the bill still faces an uphill path to 60 votes.                   Bryan Pagliano had previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.   A former computer technology aide to Hillary Clinton repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment Wednesday during a court-ordered deposition in a lawsuit related to Clinton's private email set-up, according a conservative group pressing the legal case. Tech specialist Bryan Pagliano asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination "more than 125 times" during the testimony, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in an interview. In addition to refusing to answer questions based on the Fifth Amendment, Pagliano's attorneys repeatedly stepped in to block answers to other queries they said went beyond the scope of topics allowed by U. S.  District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, Fitton said. "On many of the key issues, he took the Fifth," Fitton said.  "He took the Fifth even on questions about his resume.  They had a very narrow definition of what discovery" was permitted, the Judicial Watch official said. Asked what questions Pagliano did answer, Fitton said he believed the tech aide acknowledged that he had read documents shown him by attorneys at the deposition. Pagliano's lead attorney, Mark MacDougall, declined to comment Wednesday. Pagliano worked as a computer specialist on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, then joined the State Department while she served as secretary of state.  During that time, he was also being paid by the Clintons to maintain their private server at their home in Chappaqua, N. Y.  Those payments were not reported on Pagliano's financial disclosure at State, officials said. Fitton said that, in addition to MacDougall, three other attorneys from law firm Akin Gump representing Pagliano attended the deposition Wednesday.  The former IT aide declined to answer a question about who was paying for his legal counsel, Fitton added. Pagliano previously invoked the Fifth Amendment during private testimony before the House Benghazi Committee.  After initially declining to speak with FBI investigators, the tech specialist struck a limited immunity deal with prosecutors and spoke with investigators. Pagliano's attorneys asked that his deposition in the Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act suit not be videotaped, citing the potential for the tape to be used to embarrass him or to taint a jury in a potential criminal case.  Sullivan declined to block the videotaping, but he did order that all videos of depositions in the case be put under seal. However, the transcript of Pagliano's questioning is expected to be released as soon as Thursday. Fitton said he hopes Sullivan will view Pagliano's assertion of the Fifth Amendment as evidence that Clinton's private email setup may have been designed to evade the Freedom of Information Act.  "The judge can draw negative inferences about whether there was an effort to subvert FOIA," Fitton said. In a speech Wednesday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump again slammed Clinton over her email system, including her decision to delete about 32,000 messages her attorneys deemed personal. "While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So, they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States," Trump said.  "This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. "In response, Clinton's presidential campaign cited news stories saying logs from the server offer no indication that it was hacked. Closed-door depositions in the FOIA lawsuit are scheduled to continue next week, with testimony expected from former Clinton Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy.                  Brent Scowcroft's endorsement of Hillary Clinton comes after his fellow foreign-policy realist Richard Armitage's endorsement a week prior.   Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W.  Bush, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Wednesday. "Secretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the world s indispensable leader," Scowcroft said in a statement, touting her experience as secretary of state.  "She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous.  She appreciates that it is essential to maintain our strong military advantage, but that force must only be used as a last resort. "Clinton, Scowcroft stated, "brings deep expertise in international affairs, and a sophisticated understanding of the world," qualities he described as "essential for the Commander-in-Chief. ""Her longstanding relationships with a wide array of world leaders, and their sense of her as a strong and reliable counterpart, make her uniquely prepared for the highest office in the land," he added. Scowcroft's endorsement comes after his fellow foreign-policy realist Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state under George W.  Bush, told POLITICO last week that he would support Clinton over Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee. "I believe Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time," Scowcroft stated. Scowcroft has said little on the record about Trump's foreign policy ideas and qualifications.  But Bush, his former boss in the White House, has made no secret of his distaste for Trump.  And the Atlantic Council, of which the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security is a part, has offered pointed criticism of Trump's foreign policy prescriptions. "If Donald Trump wants to 'make America great again' on a global stage, he cannot do so without NATO," wrote Robbie Gramer, an associate director of the Scowcroft Center's Transatlantic Security Initiative, in a March 23 blog post. R.  Nicholas Burns, a board director and Clinton adviser who served as the No.  3 official in George W.  Bush's State Department, denounced Trump as "dangerous" in a late April interview.                  Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert reports to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn. , on  June 22 to begin serving a 15-month sentence in a hush money case.    The Rochester Post-Bulletin/APFormer House Speaker Dennis Hastert surrendered to authorities at a federal prison hospital in Minnesota Wednesday to begin serving a 15-month sentence related to hush money he paid to conceal sexual abuse of students while he was a high school teacher and coach more than three decades ago, a prison official said. Citing several serious health issues facing the ex-speaker, Hastert's attorneys had urged U. S.  District Court Judge Thomas Durkin not to impose any prison sentence in the case.  But at sentencing in April, the judge called Hastert's conduct "unforgivable" and sentenced him to more than double the zero-to-six months prosecutors had requested. The judge did agree to Hastert's attorneys request to recommend that the Bureau of Prisons house Hastert at the Federal Medical Center at Rochester, Minn. , so that he could be treated for effects of a stroke, spinal surgery, a blood infection and diabetes. Prosecutors said Hastert abused at least four boys at the Yorkville, Ill.  high school where he served as a wrestling coach and social studies teacher.  However, the statute of limitations on those events ran out long ago. The federal felony charge the former speaker pled guilty to last year was illegal structuring of bank withdrawals related to an agreement to pay $3. 5 million to one of the victims. After being warned by bank officials that his large cash withdrawals were being reported to federal authorities, Hastert began taking money out in increments of less than $10,000 to try to avoid those reports being issued.  Breaking up deposits or withdrawals to avoid reporting requirements is a violation of federal law. Hastert paid $1. 7 million of the promised compensation before he was confronted by the FBI early last year.  The recipient of the funds, who has not been publicly identified, is now suing the former speaker for the remainder. Durkin also ordered the ex-speaker to pay a $250,000 fine in the criminal case, which he did last month. Hastert spent more than 20 years in the House and served for eight years as speaker, making him the longest-serving Republican speaker in history.                  House Democrats, including Rep.  Joe Courtney (left) and Rep.  John Lewis (center), participate in a sit-in June 22  on the House floor seeking a vote on gun control measures.   Rep.  John Yarmuth via APThat was definitely not your father s C-SPAN. Wednesday s dramatic protest on the House floor over gun control was a powerful reminder of how dramatically the cable network s role as the official chronicler of Congress has changed since its early years   and how technology has suddenly made C-SPAN less beholden to the congressional leaders who control its video feed inside the chambers. It all unfolded quickly: When the sit-in began Wednesday morning, Republican leaders ordered the House into recess.  And since only they, and not C-SPAN, oversee the camera, C-SPAN s feed was cut off, as dictated by the chamber s rules. Normally, that would have been end of story. But in a move that would not have been possible even five years ago, C-SPAN picked up a live video feed from a lawmaker recording the sit-in from inside the chamber   doing an end-run around House leaders. The video feed   and the power to control it   was once a real lever of power in Congress.  As a newcomer to the House in 1979 looking to make a name for himself, Newt Gingrich used C-SPAN, which had just launched months earlier, to full effect, regularly blasting Democrats before the budding audience of cable subscribers.  Five years later, after Gingrich accused Democrats of being  blind to communism,  House Speaker Tip O Neill used C-SPAN to exact revenge, ordering the House cameras to pan across an empty chamber as one Republican lawmaker was making a speech. Congress  tight control over what its viewers see has long been a source of frustration for C-SPAN, which has been trying to get its own cameras on the floor of since 1984.  But congressional leaders, whether Democratic or Republican, have maintained power over the cameras, the audio, the angles and when they re turned on and off. That all changed on Wednesday afternoon, when members of Congress themselves became the cameras, using their smartphones to broadcast the sit-in live directly to C-SPAN after the network s access to video feeds from the House floor was cut, despite the fact there were dozens of Democratic lawmakers still there, making speeches and making news.  Speaker of the House Rep.  Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) blasted the move, calling it a  publicity stunt.   His spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said that because the House had gone into recess, the feed had to go.  Rules are rules. But C-SPAN soon found a way around those rules.  This is a milestone moment,  said C-SPAN spokesman Howard Mortman, who said he was inundated with calls and interest on Wednesday.   We ve got a commitment to C-SPAN as a public service, a privately funded public service to connect Americans to Congress to show what's happening in Congress   this certainly rises to the event of something happening in Congress. " With the cameras turned off, C-SPAN began broadcasting a Periscope livestream of the floor from Rep.  Scott Peters (D-Calif. ), with the full graphics afforded to normal video feeds of the House floor.  The network also switched at times to a Facebook Live feed from Rep.  Beto O Rourke (D-Texas) and others.  All three cable networks also picked up on portions of the livestream, but C-SPAN carried it for the entire duration and continues to do so as of this publishing. "Cameras in chamber controlled by house.  House is currently in recess subject to call.  House cameras are not permitted to show sit-in," read the "Alert" on the bottom of C-SPAN s shot explaining the situation.  Peters, speaking just off the House floor on an aide s phone while his own kept up the broadcast, told POLITICO the idea for the livestream came from a young aide, who texted him the suggestions.  Having never used the services before, Peters said he downloaded the Periscope app from the House floor and began broadcasting.  Technically, it s against House rules to film from the House floor.  But Peters said the sit-in was breaking the rules anyway, so he figured he d keep going.  This is a protest.  If Rep.  John Lewis is going to sit on the House floor, that s against the rules, so I thought it s better for people to know about it,  Peters said.   I think it s appropriate as part of a protest.  I really respect the rules of the House and don t expect to break them, but today I think it s appropriate for the American people to know what the heck is going on. "About six phones were livestreaming at a time, Peters guessed.  At one point, he said, CBS called trying to connect to his feed.  The attention is vital to the keeping up the sit-in, Peters said:  If no one were watching or knew we were here, it would be more difficult to sustain.  We don t have a filibuster mechanism that keeps the House open.  We re technically in adjournment so it s really the only way for us to make a point. "In the past, lawmakers hoping to pull off similar stunts would have been out of luck.  In 2008, when they were in power, Democrats recessed and even cut power when a group of Republican lawmakers, led by then-Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) opposed a motion to adjourn the House, arguing that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to schedule a vote allowing offshore drilling was hurting the American economy.  They refused to leave the floor for five hours, but the only way the protest was broadcast was via reporters observing from the press galleries.  It s always a big misunderstanding.  People think we re in charge of the cameras but we re not, we re not the government,  C-SPAN s Mortman said.   This is an opportunity to explain how we operate and how TV gets from the House floor into American households.  This is a great moment.   Both Twitter and Facebook have invested heavily in Capitol Hill, dedicating staff members to training members of Congress on how to use their competing livestream features.  Twitter featured the sit-in as a  Twitter Moment,  Periscope (which is owned by Twitter) dedicated a channel to it, and Facebook featured livestreams of the sit-in in its trending box with a red  LIVE  button. "Today is an example of what drives us.  Twitter and Periscope take you where other cameras don't   letting you experience breaking news through the eyes of those living it,  Periscope co-founder and CEO Kayvon Beykpour said in a statement.  Twitter and Facebook are extremely eager   as is Google, owner of YouTube   to capitalize on the enormous interest in the 2016 campaign because it validates their claims that they are the  townhall  where modern American politics is playing out. But good government and transparency aren't the only motives   the social-media giants are in a battle to the death over their respective livestreaming platforms, seeing the technology as a way to compete with TV networks for eyeballs and advertising dollars.  Facebook Live is such a priority for the company that it is paying around $50 million to media companies and celebrities to use the product, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. In a dig at Facebook, Twitter spokesmman Nick Pacilio shared the Journal s report on Wednesday, reminding followers  we're not paying anyone to use Periscope.   He later noted that tweets sent by Peters and Rep.  Eric Swalwell (D-Calif. ) with videos had been viewed more than a million times each.  We may not have Chewbacca, but we have democracy,  tweeted Beykpour, in a reference to a viral Facebook Live video of a woman laughing as she wore a mask of the Star Wars character.  (That video has been viewed 157 million times. )Facebook declined to respond to Twitter s taunts. As of 7:30 p. m.  Wednesday evening, the sit-in and the livestreaming were still going, with no clear end in sight. Nancy Scola and Li Zhou contributed to this report. Your guide to the media circus.

Sen.  Chuck Schumer: "There are a few concerns that are being worked on and I believe will be worked out, and I have every expectation of supporting the bill. "  John ShinkleSenate Democrats are coalescing behind a gun control compromise drafted in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in modern U. S.  history, amplifying pressure on the Republican authors of the bill to find more GOP backers on a measure that is opposed by the powerful National Rifle Association.  The top three Senate Democratic leaders said Wednesday they would support the compromise being drafted by Sen.  Susan Collins (R-Maine) and a bipartisan coalition of senators, which would allow the Justice Department to block people on two key federal terror lists from purchasing firearms. Senior Democrats predicted as many as 40 Democratic senators could ultimately back Collins, though the fine print of her bill continued to be in flux.   I m all for a bipartisan compromise,  Sen.  Chuck Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, said Wednesday evening.   There are a few concerns that are being worked on and I believe will be worked out, and I have every expectation of supporting the bill.  Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office continued to give no indication Wednesday when the Collins plan would come up for a vote.  According to multiple sources, one option under discussion that could tee up a Thursday vote was moving to table the Collins gun plan, which its supporters are trying to add as an amendment to a broader funding bill for the Justice Department.  There would need to be 51 votes for the Collins proposal to be tabled.  The twist is that it may not get tabled because most of the 46-member Senate Democratic Caucus and at least a half-dozen Republicans support the Collins measure.  But it would be a way for McConnell to demonstrate that the compromise did not have 60 votes needed to advance essentially any legislation in the Senate.  A McConnell spokesman said Wednesday evening that there were no announcements to make on scheduling of votes. Meanwhile, a handful of Senate Republicans up for reelection   who are facing perhaps the most scrutiny on gun measures   cast significant doubt whether the Collins proposal was something they could support.  That meant reaching 60 votes remained a significant hurdle. And Republicans, including those pushing for the compromise and senators who are undecided, have to reckon with the expansive influence of the NRA.  The gun-rights group has denounced the Collins plan as  unconstitutional,  effectively ensuring most Republicans will oppose it.  Pro-gun control advocates were doing their own lobbying, with Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep.  Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz. ), personally calling GOP senators to urge a compromise on barring potential terrorists from obtaining firearms.  It ll have some impact.  I don t know how much,  said Sen.  Jeff Flake of Arizona, one Republican supporting the compromise proposal, of the NRA opposition.   Most people are concerned about doing something that helps and with due process provisions.  And this has it.   Other top Senate Republicans indicated they wished the NRA would ve held off on opposing it.  I mean, my preference would be that they wait until we get final language before they react to it too much,  said Sen.  John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Senate Republican.   I think until it s final language, it s been, kind of, in a continual state of evolution.  Collins and her cohorts picked up support from another Senate Republican on Wednesday: Mark Kirk of Illinois, who has usually voted with Democrats on gun policy.  But other vulnerable GOP senators echoed concerns voiced by some in Republican leadership   that Collins  bill lacked sufficient review for people who may be denied a gun because they wrongly ended up on either the No-Fly list or the so-called Selectee list.  Between the two federal lists, about 109,000 people could potentially be barred from purchasing weapons, with just 2,700 of them being U. S.  citizens or green-card holders, according to the bill s authors.  Sen.  Rob Portman of Ohio, who s facing a serious Democratic challenge in his reelection bid, continued to voice due process concerns on Wednesday.  Sen.  John McCain of Arizona said  of course I have concerns; that s why I m reviewing.   Sen.  Richard Burr of North Carolina said he had similar problems with the bill, and added another: the 14-day period, during which the federal government has to make its case for denying a gun sale if that decision is appealed, is too long.   I think there s still some very serious concerns about  due process provisions in Collins  plan, said Sen.  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, another vulnerable Senate Republican.   Listen, I think there s a way of doing this, but I don t think they re doing it yet.  Flake and others are also lobbying Sen.  Marco Rubio (R-Fla. ), who just announced Wednesday that he would run for reelection and who represents the state where the Orlando massacre, which killed 49 people and injured dozens of others, occurred June 12.  Rubio s office said the senator is reviewing the legislation but he had made no final decision.  Two other Senate Republicans running in high-profile reelection bids this fall   Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania   are supporting the Collins legislation.  Sen.  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a perennial GOP deal maker, also backs the bill. Both Ayotte, a former prosecutor, and Collins dismissed the prospect of including a provision that would require the federal government to show probable cause that the person buying a gun would commit terrorism   a standard favored by Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas.  I am not for probable cause being the standard,  Collins said.   If probable cause is the standard, you could arrest the people  rather than merely denying them a gun.  The quiet lobbying, persuasion tactics and legislating were happening in the Senate as their Democratic counterparts in the House seized control of their chamber earlier Wednesday.  Dozens of House lawmakers commandeered the floor and launched a high-profile sit-in at the well of the chamber to demand Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) hold a gun control vote.  That tactic was akin to the nearly 15-hour gun filibuster led by Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ) and other Senate Democrats last week.  Indeed, more than two dozen Senate Democrats visited the House chamber, which stayed in recess for much of the day Wednesday, to show their support.  Sen.  Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and the party s chief vote-counter, said he would also back the legislation and he believed most of the 46-member Senate Democratic Caucus would rally around the Collins plan.   Certainly, a lot of these Republicans are going to have to face the music when one of their own comes up with a bipartisan amendment to address this issue,  Durbin said, as he walked over to the House chamber to lend support to Democrats staging the sit-in.   It makes it more difficult for them to vote no.                   Undated photo or selfie of Omar Mateen, identified as the gunman in mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida on June 12.    A man who claimed to be the lover of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen said the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub was motivated by revenge, not terrorism. In an interview with Univision, the man said Mateen was  100 percent gay  and that the two had carried on a  friends with benefits  relationship after meeting last year through a gay dating app.  He said he had reported his relationship with Mateen to the FBI and had been interviewed multiple times.  The FBI also confirmed to Univision that it has met with him. The man, who wore a disguise in his interview with Univision and was identified only as  Miguel,  said Mateen s attack at Orlando s Pulse nightclub was the result of a sexual encounter with two Latino men, one of which Mateen later discovered was HIV positive.  The attack, carried out at the nightclub s Latino night, was Mateen s attempt at taking revenge against a specific community of gay men who he felt had used and rejected him, the man said.  He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin, but he felt rejected.  He felt used by them.  There were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad.  Guys used him.  That really affected him,  Miguel told Univision.  "I believe this crazy horrible thing he did, that was revenge. "Miguel described Mateen as a  very sweet guy  who  loved to be cuddled  and frequented gay bars.  He said he was stunned when he discovered Mateen had been the shooter at Pulse, that it was  impossible that the man I know could do that.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said investigators are still looking into Mateen's contacts from the months leading up to the attack.  We stand with you to say that the good in this world far outweighs the evil, that our common humanity transcends our differences, and that our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, it s unity, and it s love,  Lynch told reporters, specifically addressing the LGBT community, on Tuesday.   We stand with you today as we grieve together, and long after the cameras are gone, we will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment, in solidarity, and in equality.

Donald Trump, after six bruising weeks since becoming the GOP s presumptive nominee, finally punched hard at his general election opponent.  Appearing to heed the advice of top adviser Paul Manafort and others urging him to adapt the freewheeling approach from the primary into a less bombastic general election bearing, the presumptive GOP nominee stuck to the scripted speech in the teleprompter Wednesday as he laid out his most cohesive case to date against Hillary Clinton, hitting the presumptive Democratic nominee with many of the same brutal attack lines she's been directing at him.  She doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgment, to be president,  Trump said.   She believes she is entitled to the office.  Her campaign slogan is  I m with her.   You know what my response to that is?  he continued.   I m with you: the American people.   Trump threw the entire RNC opposition file at Clinton, questioning her integrity over the deleted emails from her private server, suggesting that a nexus between State Department business and her global philanthropy and lucrative private speechmaking and blaming her personally for the death of former Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others in Benghazi.  And he borrowed from a widely debunked book about the Clintons, arguing that Bill Clinton s paid speeches in China influenced his wife s decisions as Secretary of State.  She gets rich making you poor,  Trump said.   She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing.  He continued to provoke, but in a somewhat tempered and at times more presidential tone   a shift perhaps eased by the dismissal of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the combative Trump loyalist regarded as an enabler of Trump s most controversial impulses.  Long confident but carefree, Trump looked different Wednesday morning as he stood behind a lectern in his Soho hotel; he looked like a candidate serious about trying to win in November. "You can really see a difference between a Corey and a Manafort approach,  said Michael Steele, the former RNC chairman.   Corey would say  just go for it.   Manafort is telling him he has to define a narrative and stick to it; and he clearly is trying to turn some corners.  The test is can he sustain that.  The next interview he gives, can he stay on message and drive those points home?"Even with Lewandowski out of Trump s inner circle, Trump is still Trump.  And after a year of incendiary, off the cuff speeches blending schoolyard insults and conspiracy theories, donors and establishment Republicans unnerved by Trump s lack of focus are nervously eyeing Twitter and the cable TV airwaves for a knee-jerk utterance that could undercut any attempted pivot.  When the bar is low, you can exceed it,  said Ryan Williams, a GOP operative who worked on Mitt Romney s 2012 campaign.   It was the type of speech one would expect to hear from a major candidate, different from the rambling, unscripted ones he s given for the last year.  And it was the first major speech after the change in leadership within the campaign and demonstrated self-discipline and I think will give some people a little more confidence in the campaign.  But he needs to keep it up.  One speech isn't going to change people's perceptions.  Facing the prospect of self-financing his campaign to keep pace with Clinton, who has some $42 million in the bank compared to Trump's own $1. 3 million total, the presumptive GOP nominee has been intensifying his courtship of a skeptical Republican donor class, aiming to bolster his campaign and help fill RNC coffers with the party s congressional majorities hanging in the balance.  Performing more consistently on the stump, Williams said, should help.  Whoever gave him the advice to give that kind of speech was right and he was right to listen to them,  Williams said.   Is it going win him the election today? No.  But at this point he needs to rebuild confidence in his campaign.  If he's going to go out and raise money from donors, he needs to be confident in that effort.  Trump branded Clinton a  world class liar,  attacking her for supporting the Iraq war, the war in Libya and the Obama administration s decision to withdraw U. S.  troops from Iraq   all of which Trump has expressed support for.  And he continued to misrepresent reality with broad-brush statements, by asserting that the government has no vetting process for refugees seeking asylum, by claiming that Iran is the  dominant power in the Middle East  and even by mistakenly characterizing jobs that have been relocated to Mexico as having been moved  overseas.  Donald Trump's mendacity and continued disregard for detail mattered less to frantic Republicans than him simply staying on message for an hour. "He really doesn't have that high a bar,  said Curt Anderson, a GOP strategist in Washington.   It's high for him, but it's wouldn't be that high for a normal human: just be uninteresting, not inflammatory and don't screw up and he'll be in a tight race.  Most politicians, you re trying to help them be more interesting.  If Trump could just master being boring, he'd be good.  But not all GOP operatives agree that Trump is well served by reining in the rhetoric or even capable of doing so.  His reputation has been established by now,  said Liz Mair, a GOP communications consultant.   John Kerry and Mitt Romney tried to pivot, too.  It doesn t work.  You are who you are   you can t be one guy in the primaries and another in the general.  It tends to just piss off your primary backers and it doesn t play well with anyone else.  And in an era of Internet dominance and Google, it s particularly impossible to do that.

And in an era of Internet dominance and Google, it s particularly impossible to do that.                   Donald Trump's anti-Hillary Clinton won over some Republicans, but others were just as resolute in their opposition to him.   Donald Trump s Wednesday attack on Hillary Clinton was, for many Republicans, exactly what they d been waiting for: a disciplined, scripted attack on what the GOP contends is a deeply flawed Democratic candidate. But with Trump, it s never quite that simple: Even as some Republicans praised his anti-Clinton jeremiad, others ripped their party s presumptive nominee for pushing a policy agenda that, at points, strayed far from the party line.  There was a lot to like.  He did an effective job of connecting Hillary Clinton to the Washington cartel that is the insiders game and effectively connected her to her record . . .  He effectively gave the voters a choice between more of the same, anemic job growth versus a new vision,  said Rick Tyler, the former communications director for Sen.  Ted Cruz s presidential campaign. But in his assessment of Trump s economic proposals, Tyler was more muted:  I don't think he s ideologically steeped in how economies work,  he said of Trump. Others couldn t get past Trump s attacks on international trade deals, which have often enjoyed Republican support over the objections of Democrats.  This is a populist speech.  It speaks for a faction of the Republican Party but it certainly does not speak for most people who have considered themselves economic conservatives,  said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market R Street Institute think tank and former speechwriter for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, noting Trump s broadside against the North American Free Trade Agreement.   NAFTA and free trade agreements like it are key to the open and competitive economy that conservatives have traditionally favored.  The rift between Trump and conservatives is nothing new.  Throughout the primary, Trump turned his heterodox views into an asset, painting himself as a fighter for the American worker who was the lone candidate capable of taking power away from the elites and restoring prosperity to a working class in decline.  But that message has gotten lost of late amid Trump s attacks on a federal judge and his harsh comments about Muslims. On Wednesday, Trump was much more disciplined, making an explicit appeal to Bernie Sanders  supporters and lifting the Vermont senator s language on a  rigged  economy and framing of a struggle between  large corporations  and struggling American workers. It s a delicate dance for Trump as he works to expand his support past the base that propelled him to the top of the GOP field but still leaves him trailing Clinton in national polls.  Traditionally, the onset of general election has seen candidates work to win over moderates, but Trump seemed to be aiming Wednesday s speech at the  radical center    downscale white voters who generally don t fit on the traditional political spectrum. If so, his conservative critics said, it was unlikely that Trump s message would win over new supporters.   I can t see this speech getting anybody who doesn t support Trump already to support him and a handful of people who might think that he s going to temper some of this economic populism will probably be sorely disappointed,  said Lehrer. Still, Trump and the GOP remain in lockstep in one area: their disapproval of Clinton, both in her personal dealings and her policy record.  It s a good start because it walks through both the failures that Hillary had and where he wants to go,  said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.   What people need to see and hear is the focus he had in the primaries which was so effective: jobs: jobs, jobs.  And Rush Limbaugh, for one, was delighted by the tack Trump took in ripping Clinton, saying he would traffic in territory that other Republicans wouldn t. Indeed, many of Trump s attacks were either unsourced or were at odds with publicly available information   his assertion, for instance, that Clinton is backed financially by  Communist China    but Limbaugh saw that as Trump being willing to take off the gloves in a way that a more genteel class of politician wouldn t.  So Trump basically said things about Hillary Clinton that you just don't hear Republicans saying   But you just do not hear Mitt Romney say this, for example.  You wouldn't hear the Bush family talk this way about Hillary,  Limbaugh said.   You wouldn't hear fellow establishment types talk about this, 'cause it's too close to home for all of them.  But Trump can say this stuff as an outsider.  Following Trump's speech, Tucker Carlson, editor in chief of conservative website The Daily Caller, captured conservatives' ongoing ambivalence over their party's presumptive nominee: "Like everything with Trump, it was both exhilarating to hear someone tell the truth but very frustrating to hear someone articulate it badly or muddy it with irrelevancies. "Nick Gass contributed to this report.   It's rooted in the values that I learned from my family and my faith.  We are all in this together, and we have a responsibility to lift each other up,  Hillary Clinton said. Hillary Clinton showed no signs Wednesday of slowing her verbal onslaught on Donald Trump, using the former reality TV star s most famous words against him to present herself as the best candidate to improve America s economy. After casting Trump as an economic danger, attacking his bombastic, controversial rhetoric on America s economy and mocking his business record on Tuesday, Clinton continued driving that message while also presenting an economic plan she said would work for everyone.  Maybe we shouldn t expect better from someone whose most famous words are  You re fired,   Clinton told supporters during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, after pointing to Trump s proposals.   Well, here s what I want you to know: I do have a jobs program, and as president I m gonna make sure that you hear  You re hired.   Clinton boasted that the billionaire businessman  hates it  when anybody  points out how hollow his sales pitch really is.   And I guess my speech yesterday must have gotten under his skin because right away he lashed out on Twitter with outlandish lies and conspiracy theories, and he did the same in his speech today,  Clinton said.  Trump blasted Clinton on Wednesday morning in his long-awaited remarks about the former secretary of state, accusing her of being a  world-class liar  who  may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.   He presented his rival as another corrupt politician who s beholden to donors and special interests and blamed her leadership   or lack thereof   at the State Department for the rise of the Islamic State.  He even attacked her  old and tired  message and mocked her campaign slogan,  I m with her.   You know what my response to that is? I m with you, the American people,  Trump said to applause.   She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you.  I know it s all about making America great again for all Americans.  Though he lodged a barrage of attacks at Clinton during his speech, Trump didn t sit idly by when it was Clinton s turn.  The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted as Clinton was speaking that the choice in November is  between Americanism and her corrupt globalism    while including the hash tag #Imwithyou. Clinton suggested that Trump was attacking her personally  because he has no answers on the substance.   All he can do is try to distract us.  That s even why he s attacking my faith   sigh   and of course attacking a philanthropic foundation that saves and improves lives around the world,  Clinton said.   It s no surprise he doesn t understand these things.  The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to life-saving AIDS medicine.  Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties.  Clinton highlighted her faith just minutes into her speech, implicitly firing back at Trump, who in a video published via Twitter by Christian conservative E. W.  Jackson on Tuesday claimed that  there s nothing out there  about Clinton s faith.  (Clinton has said she is Methodist and has talked about it on multiple occasions, including on the campaign trail, and Trump later told CBS he didn t mean his remark  in a negative way ). Clinton said every child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential, calling that the cause of her life.   It's rooted in the values that I learned from my family and my faith.  We are all in this together, and we have a responsibility to lift each other up,  she added.   As we Methodists like to say,  Do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can,  and that is absolutely true for our children.  That's why I got into public service in the first place, and it's why I am determined that we will win this election in November.   Clinton reiterated her refrain that Trump has no real solutions, arguing that he spews reckless ideas that would  run up our debt and cause another economic crash.   I'm here today to offer an alternative,  she said.  And she did.  Clinton spoke of an economy that worked for everyone   one that would drive lasting growth, reduce inequality and improve upward mobility.  She advocated for a range of Democratic positions like an increase in the national minimum wage, equal pay for women, paid family leave and debt-free college and vowed not to raise taxes on the middle class and to work with Republicans to pass a comprehensive plan to create the next generation of good-paying jobs.   The measure of our success will be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, how many children are lifted out of poverty, how many Americans can find good jobs that support a middle class life and not only that, jobs that provide a sense of dignity and pride,  Clinton said.   That's what it means to have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.  That's the mission, and I'm asking all of you to join me in it.    She poked at Republicans  theory of so-called  trickle-down economics,  arguing that although it s been repeatedly proven wrong, Republicans in Congress still favor tax cuts for the wealthy.   They careen from one self-inflicted crisis to another, shutting down the government, threatening to default on our national debt, refusing to make the common sense investments that used to have broad bipartisan support, like rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, our airports or investing in better education from zero through high school and college,  Clinton said.  Republicans, she continued, have lost sight of their responsibility, adding that they allow Wall Street to take big risks and undermine workers  rights.   It's not easy to change Washington or how corporations behave.  It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan,  she said, taking another shot at Trump and his  Make America Great Again  slogan.   It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.  And that means   that means we need a president who knows what we're up against, has no illusions about what we need to do to move ahead but can actually get it done, and that is what I am offering.  Clinton said her campaign has highlighted how it will pay for the policies she has proposed.  Then she mocked Trump again. He  and I disagree on a lot of things,  she said,  and one of them is simple math.   We need to write a new chapter in the American dream and it can t be Chapter 11,  Clinton added, echoing an applause line from her speech the previous day.   So, please, join me in this campaign.  I m offering a very different vision about how we re stronger together when we grow together.  We re stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Clinton s strategy to double down on progressive ideas was wise.  Keeping the volume high on popular progressive ideas gets Clinton a two-fer, bringing Bernie Sanders supporters along for the ride while fending off Donald Trump's attempt to woo swing voters with his faux economic populism,  he said.   Campaigning as a bold progressive on issues like expanding Social Security, debt-free college, and Wall Street reform is both a smart Democratic unity strategy and a smart general election strategy.

She advocated for a range of Democratic positions like an increase in the national minimum wage, equal pay for women, paid family leave and debt-free college and vowed not to raise taxes on the middle class and to work with Republicans to pass a comprehensive plan to create the next generation of good-paying jobs.   The measure of our success will be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, how many children are lifted out of poverty, how many Americans can find good jobs that support a middle class life and not only that, jobs that provide a sense of dignity and pride,  Clinton said.   That's what it means to have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.  That's the mission, and I'm asking all of you to join me in it.    She poked at Republicans  theory of so-called  trickle-down economics,  arguing that although it s been repeatedly proven wrong, Republicans in Congress still favor tax cuts for the wealthy.   They careen from one self-inflicted crisis to another, shutting down the government, threatening to default on our national debt, refusing to make the common sense investments that used to have broad bipartisan support, like rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our tunnels, our highways, our airports or investing in better education from zero through high school and college,  Clinton said.  Republicans, she continued, have lost sight of their responsibility, adding that they allow Wall Street to take big risks and undermine workers  rights.   It's not easy to change Washington or how corporations behave.  It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan,  she said, taking another shot at Trump and his  Make America Great Again  slogan.   It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.  And that means   that means we need a president who knows what we're up against, has no illusions about what we need to do to move ahead but can actually get it done, and that is what I am offering.  Clinton said her campaign has highlighted how it will pay for the policies she has proposed.  Then she mocked Trump again. He  and I disagree on a lot of things,  she said,  and one of them is simple math.   We need to write a new chapter in the American dream and it can t be Chapter 11,  Clinton added, echoing an applause line from her speech the previous day.   So, please, join me in this campaign.  I m offering a very different vision about how we re stronger together when we grow together.  We re stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Clinton s strategy to double down on progressive ideas was wise.  Keeping the volume high on popular progressive ideas gets Clinton a two-fer, bringing Bernie Sanders supporters along for the ride while fending off Donald Trump's attempt to woo swing voters with his faux economic populism,  he said.   Campaigning as a bold progressive on issues like expanding Social Security, debt-free college, and Wall Street reform is both a smart Democratic unity strategy and a smart general election strategy.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi walks with Hillary Clinton to a House Democratic Caucus meeting on June 22, 2016.   John Shinkle Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton got a raucous welcome from House Democrats on Wednesday during her first visit to Capitol Hill since effectively clinching the nomination. The theme of the day was one word   unity, unity   and more unity, and she entered the meeting to chants of  Hillary, Hillary!  We need to unify the country,  Clinton said to applause. Invited to address rank-and-file lawmakers by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ) and Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra of California, Clinton told Democrats that she will compete in all 50 states and coordinate as much as possible with Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents. But Clinton also noted that battleground states will get the most attention, as would be expected.   I mean, I ve been to Ohio three times,  Clinton said, according to one Democratic lawmaker. Clinton also spoke about how she unified Democrats in 2008 following a long, bitter primary battle with now President Barack Obama, even though her supporters urged her to continue opposing Obama. Although Democrats have nowhere near the turmoil that Republicans face over Donald Trump, Clinton and Democratic leaders must work to win over the progressive wing of the party, which had strongly supported Sen.  Bernie Sanders (I-Vt. ) in his bid for the nomination.  While Sanders had only a fraction of Clinton s support among House Democrats, party officials are keenly aware that they need  Bernie voters  to win in November. There were some light moments in the meeting, as well.  When Becerra   who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick   offered Clinton some water, Rep.  Joe Crowley of New York joked,  Man, you re really working it.   The Democrats erupted in laughter. Top Democrats played up their cohesion heading into the Wednesday session.  You ve got the next president of the United States, here.  It s going to be all positive things,  said Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland.  This will be about unity.  It is time to come together,  said Rep.  Gerry Connolly (D-Va. ).   And she will probably be reaching out to the Sanders wing.  As I said the other day, it takes two wings to fly, and both sides of our party are an asset, not a problem.   I expect we will see here a fighting spirit now that she has the nomination,  added Rep.  Sandy Levin (D-Mich. ). Republicans responded to the Clinton visit by issuing statements bashing the Democratic standard-bearer, and GOP leadership aides noted privately that the Benghazi committee   chaired by Rep.  Trey Gowdy (R-S. C. )   is still drafting its report on the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead, including the U. S.  ambassador to Libya.  Clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state remains under investigation by the FBI.  FBI target and presumptive Democrat nominee for president, Hillary Clinton, is meeting on Capitol Hill this morning with House Democrats.  What will Clinton and House Democrats discuss?  asked the National Republican Congressional Committee in a news release.   Perhaps Hillary and House Democrats can discuss how to prevent her toxic image among voters from doing further damage to down ballot candidates in November.  Rachael Bade contributed to this report.  Sen.  Bernie Sanders acknowledged Wednesday that his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president aren't ideal.  "It doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee, so I'm not going to be determining the scope of the convention," Sanders said during an interview with C-SPAN.  The comment came in response to a question about his preparations for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in late July.  The comment is notable because the Vermont senator has refused to formally drop out of the Democratic presidential primary and instead has vowed to push his policy agenda at the convention.  Sanders' comments suggest that despite the fact that he's signaled he plans to use his 1,879 delegates to wring concessions from Hillary Clinton and her supporters in Philadelphia, he understands that his leverage may ultimately prove limited. Sanders said he remains determined, however, to press for reforms to the party's nominating process: above all, to change the superdelegate system that has given Clinton an unassailable advantage among elected officials and other party insiders. "They should reflect the votes of the people in their states.  We have won states with 70, 80 percent of the vote where superdelegates are going to vote for my opponent," Sanders said.  "That's not terribly democratic. " Sen.  Bernie Sanders acknowledged Wednesday that his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president aren't ideal.

"That's not terribly democratic. "                 Marco Rubio's fellow presidential also-rans in the Senate, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, didn't have much to say about Rubio running for reelection.   By all rights, fellow Senate Republicans should be excited that Marco Rubio wants to remain a senator   and help them keep their majority. But minutes after Rubio went public with his reelection bid, Ted Cruz had nothing to say about his former presidential rival.   Just call my press office,  Cruz said as a press aide walked behind him.  Pressed again, the aide firmly said:  He s not gonna talk about it.  Rubio s already favored to keep the seat he once promised to vacate.  But his electoral decision also makes it much more likely that the Senate Republican Conference will be even more crowded with a full stable of striving pols like Cruz and Rubio all committed to reshaping the GOP after Donald Trump s presidential run.  It s good to have a bunch of ambitious, rambunctious youngsters like us,  said Sen.  Tim Scott of South Carolina, a popular lawmaker also on an upward trajectory. Of course, it can also mean clashes between competing egos and ideological agendas.  Or in Scott s diplomatic words:  It just means we ll have more interesting family conversations.  Provided Rubio and Sen.  Rand Paul of Kentucky win reelection in races in which they are favored, they will rejoin a conference filled with relatively young senators who will be the focus of endless speculation about their future over the next four years.  There s mild-mannered conservative Scott, hawkish veteran Tom Cotton of Arkansas, never-Trump leader Ben Sasse of Nebraska, low-key Joni Ernst of Iowa, energetic Cory Gardner of Colorado and Cruz, who later issued a statement supporting Rubio. Republicans insist it s a good problem to have: Big names translate to lots of attention on the Senate and its rising stars.  But it can get messy, too: The Senate offers the perfect platform for ideological grandstanding and a single senator can shut the chamber down in an instant.  I still remember what Sen.  McConnell told me when I got here:  Welcome to the United States Senate, 100 significant egos and 200 sharp elbows.   So it s nothing new,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas.   We have a lot of people not running for office who exert their rights as a senator and can make things more challenging.  Still, Cornyn acknowledged the number of GOP senators looking for the spotlight is likely only to increase ahead of the next presidential election, compared to this year, when four GOP senators ran for president.  In particular, Cruz, Rubio and Paul were supposed to form the core of a GOP presidential field that ultimately could not compete with Trump.  It s going to be d j  vu all over again isn t it?  said Sen.  Bob Corker of Tennessee (R-Tenn. ).   I d rather be talking about all the talent on our side than the lack thereof.  Increasingly, the Senate serves as a launchpad for presidential contenders: Rubio and Cruz were the last two Republicans in the race that had any hope of beating Trump.  And as they prepared to pursue the GOP nomination, Cruz, Paul, Rubio and Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ) each used their status as powerful members of Congress to establish a national political profile, whether through compromise or conflict. Cruz famously used a filibuster to stoke a government shutdown in 2013, which boosted his profile but drove deep cracks in the GOP, and Paul single-handedly provoked a 2015 shutdown of some of the national s surveillance programs.  Later on the campaign trail, Cruz, Rubio and Paul spent months attacking one another in often blunt terms, forcing other Republican senators to choose sides or stay silent. Those wounds may not be fully healed.  And neither Cruz, nor Paul was feeling particularly loquacious on the topic of Rubio on Wednesday.  I wish him the best of luck,  Paul said.  Asked how his relationship with Rubio is these days, he replied:  I don t really want to do anymore interview than that.  Whether the Senate s biggest names can all pull together   and perhaps aid one another   over the next four months will have a significant impact on their future aspirations: If Republicans lose the majority, it will hurt their ability to set the agenda and use chairmanships to drive their message.  Rubio and Cruz, for example, have used subcommittee chairmanships to take out their frustrations on President Barack Obama and highlight issues important to them.  And Rubio in particular blamed four years of serving in the Democratic majority for souring his view of the Senate. Senate GOP leaders are taking things one step at a time: Their biggest goal at this point is simply to hold onto the majority and deal with the fallout from a crowded caucus later.  And Rubio moved the GOP ever closer to that goal by changing the dynamic of a Senate race that was getting away from Republicans.  I m pretty excited about it,  said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ).   It shouldn t be surprising to anybody we didn t want to lose him and the clearest way to keep the seat was trying to convince him to run again.  But some senators are beginning to think about what the party might look like after Trump s completed his run for president and the election is over.  The Republican majorities in the House and Senate have made initial progress clearing some deadlines from the calendar, but haven t touched contentious issues like immigration reform or a criminal justice overhaul.  And there s a government shutdown threat to deal with this fall that could hang over into next year, when the debt ceiling will again need to be raised. With a new president, Congress is likely to be invigorated by big ideas rather than the narrow priorities that McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been able to work on with Obama.  And that s where clashes among the GOP s best-known senators are most likely to manifest themselves. Rubio took the plunge into immigration reform in 2013, a move that may have hindered his presidential run among conservatives but could be beneficial to his standing in Florida.  His pursuit of normalization for undocumented immigrants runs counter to staunch conservatives like Cruz and Cotton, while newer members like Gardner and Ernst have never confronted the matter.  Congress hasn t engaged in a debate about authorizing war either   a major litmus test for those seeking the job of commander in chief. Deferred action on big-ticket policy items means that 2017 will be a major opportunity for the GOP to begin rethinking itself   particularly if it suffers a debilitating loss this year. To take over the party post-Trump, Graham advised the next generation of national candidates to think about growing the tent and competing with Democrats directly for young and minority voters.  That means confronting immigration reform and climate change rather than opposing Democratic efforts to address those issues.  You ve got to prove to people that you re bigger than your party and that you re a person of accomplishment,  Graham said.   The more on your r sum  that you did things that are hard that mattered, the better off you re going to be.  If your r sum  is: I m the chief guy who says  no?  That s not going to take you to the general election.

That s not going to take you to the general election.   In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an eleventh-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant front-runner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election is too important to miss since the GOP could potentially lose the Senate majority.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn t hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so, I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a case against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American and his experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Trump, once virtually tied with Clinton, is now trailing her by 8 points in the poll.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Still, Democrats tried to see the glass as half full.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democratic voters, and Trump has been reeling.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it would make him damaged goods and potentially close off a 2020 White House bid. Rubio was characteristically confident, though.  He dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  He has no significant achievements in his entire life,  Rubio said.   He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  As for Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation and said,  The chances are, he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office.  Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He ll have to answer for that,  Rubio said. Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate term. Asked whether he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  he said. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings on June 12, when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling with fundraising and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District.  Businessman Todd Wilcox said he s staying in the race along with Beruff. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he runs for president again. Of course, it will also give him a bigger platform and media spotlight than he d have in South Florida. Lopez-Cantera disputed the talk of a secret long-term political deal between the two.  He said he actually felt guilty because he put the  burden  on Rubio to run for the seat.  This was a selfless act,  Lopez-Cantera said.   He could have started focusing on his family and their future well-being.  Rather than plotting out a Senate bid, Rubio said, he spent weekends over the past two months planning to become the defensive coach for his son s sixth-grade football team and  designing this, if I do say so myself, pretty good defense.  I was going to get to coach my son directly because he plays safety.  I was really excited about that,  Rubio added.   I know that s kind of a small thing for people outside of it.  But for me, that was a pretty big deal.  My son will never be in sixth grade again.  In contrast, there was no Senate campaign to speak of.  Only in recent days did Rubio begin reaching out to donors (he might need as much as $50 million) and his departed presidential campaign staffers to see whether they were ready to help out. Clint Reed, Iowa director for Rubio s presidential campaign, will be his campaign manager, and Rubio s longtime consultant, Todd Harris, will serve as a strategic adviser.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan could work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the contest.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio s decision moved the seat from a  likely loss to an almost certain  hold.  It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority, so it s a big development,  McConnell said.   I m just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had.    I m pretty excited about it.  But Rubio s fellow Florida senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election. Nelson said he and Rubio  get along real well,  but  I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect.  I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.  Rubio said he s keenly aware of the risks of running for reelection and losing twice in a year   especially in an unpredictable election season like this.  I understand this was going to be a difficult race whether I announced two weeks ago or two days before qualifying,  Rubio said.   It s Florida.  General election.  Very unusual top of the ticket situation for both parties.  It s going to be tough either way.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.  As Donald Trump gears up for his all-out war on Hillary and Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican nominee on Wednesday is planning to draw ammunition from the controversies that have dogged the family, and particularly its Clinton Foundation, for years.  "I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton," Trump tweeted Tuesday, teasing out an address scheduled for Trump SoHo in New York, a day after Clinton laced into his economic and business acumen. Trump initially planned to deliver a speech, originally scheduled for June 13 in New Hampshire, "discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. " But after the Orlando attack, Trump instead refocused that address on national security.  Now, he'll be back on the attack   helped by four decades' worth of statements, association, innuendo and scandal.  And the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which has been embroiled in political controversy from its inception in 1997, is going to be at the top of Trump's target list.  Before Clinton even formally announced her campaign last spring, conservative author Peter Schweizer was writing "Clinton Cash," digging into the foundation's financial dealings and connections.  Less than a month into her run, questions resurfaced about a series of issues related to the foundation, from troublesome tax returns to myriad donations from countries with less than stellar human rights records.  And while the media frenzy has subsided somewhat in 2016, Trump's early line of attack suggests that the organization Bill Clinton describes as one that has "done a lot of good things" is about to be dragged back into a turbulent political season. In a sneak preview of the coming battle royale, Trump declared that "Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund," during a speech June 7 at his Westchester County golf club.  On Tuesday, Trump's rapid-response effort kicked into high gear, firing off multiple tweets, posts and emails seeking to undercut Clinton's argument that he would be disastrous for the economy while promoting his own policies.  And he accused the former first couple of "laundering" money and making "hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts. "There's sure to be more.  Here is a pocket guide to where Trump might attack:Tuesday's warningAs Clinton finished up her speech laying into Trump's economic policies, the Republican's burgeoning rapid-response unit sent forth an avalanche of emails, tweets and social media posts critiquing both the candidate and former president for a series of misdeeds, ranging from instances of alleged personal impropriety to broad responsibility for the state of the American economy. In the first of nine emails sent out directly before, during and minutes after the former secretary of state spoke to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, Trump's campaign pointed out that Mark Zandi, an economist who Clinton pointed out in her address advised Sen.  John McCain, had donated to the Democratic candidate and had his policies praised by the current administration. Another email sought to link Tuesday's news that Boeing had reached an agreement with Iran's largest airline as a consequence of the Iranian nuclear deal, stating, "Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terror, would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. "Trump's campaign later attacked Clinton's "lack of poise under pressure" in response to her argument that he lacks the proper temperament to be president, referring to a forthcoming book by a former Secret Service agent who wrote that what he "saw in the 1990s sickened me. "A later email alleged that as secretary of state, Clinton "laundered money" to her husband through Laureate Education while he was still an honorary chairman for the educational for-profit organization. The White House ethics agreementFoundation officials disclosed in February 2015 that one donation made during Clinton s time at Foggy Bottom violated the ethics agreement the foundation had signed with the Obama administration. The agreement was reached in 2008, before Clinton was nominated as secretary of state, as the incoming White House expressed concern about countries using the foundation to leverage political favor from the State Department.  The memo did not ban donations from foreign countries with a stake in U. S.  interests, with one exception.  The agreement blocked donations to the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosts the fancy annual Clinton Foundation event starring the former president and other world leaders.  In the one instance acknowledged as a violation more than a year ago, foundation officials said they should have submitted a $500,000 donation in 2010 from the Algerian government for its Haiti earthquake relief fund to the State Department for approval.  This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed.  This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since,  a spokesman told POLITICO at the time. Should Clinton be elected president, "there'll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it," Bill Clinton told Bloomberg TV on June 14, echoing what the campaign has said. The donations that  slipped through the cracks The day after Trump promised to unleash on the foundation, Clinton and her surrogates began a two-day media blitz.  During the first day of that press tour, they answered multiple questions about disclosure surrounding their donors, remarking that the organization went above and beyond requirements in an effort to be transparent. "We had absolutely overwhelming disclosure,  she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.   Were there, you know, one or two instances that slipped through the cracks? Yes.  But was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed? Absolutely.  The time a donor got on a sensitive intelligence boardRajiv K.  Fernando, a Democratic donor and Chicago securities trader who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board in 2011 despite lacking the qualifications of his colleagues.   We had no idea who he was,  one board member said, according to a June 10 ABC News report.  ABC's report detailed emails its journalists obtained from Citizens United through the Freedom of Information Act.  The emails further reveal how, after inquiries from ABC News, the Clinton staff sought to  protect the name  of the Secretary,  stall  the ABC News reporter and ultimately accept the resignation of the donor just two days later,  ABC reported. The emails provided to ABC, according to the report, showed a State Department official unable to immediately answer why Fernando was on the panel.  The true answer is simply that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him,  Wade Boese, who was chief of staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, wrote in an email to press aide Jamie Mannina, according to ABC s report.   Raj was not on the list sent to S secretary of state; he was added at their insistence.  Emails released by the State Department as part of the court-ordered schedule do not explicitly show Clinton being involved in Fernando s placement.  In one email from 2010 provided to ABC with the subject line  ISAB,  shorthand for the organization, chief of staff Mills wrote,  The secretary had two other names she wanted looked at.   The case of the errant tax returnsAs part of the renewed scrutiny on the Clinton Foundation in the spring of 2015, Reuters reported in April that a review showed errors in how it reported donations from foreign governments on its forms 990 from 2010 through 2012. The Clinton Foundation in November filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. "Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes," Clinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said in a statement at the time.  "Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review. " The speaking fees, part IAlso on the heels of Schweizer s book came a report from ABC News in April 2015 that Bill Clinton s speaking fees had begun to double or triple after Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. The report noted that the former president, who usually pulled down $150,000 per speech after leaving the White House, was paid $500,000 by a Russian investment bank and $750,000 to address a telecom conference in China. At a time when Bernie Sanders was pushing Clinton on her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, a CNN analysis in February found that the Clintons earned more than $153 million combined in 729 separate paid speeches from February 2001 until May 2015. The speaking fees, part IIThe same week other outlets were reporting on Schweizer s findings, The Washington Post s Rosalind Helderman reported that Bill Clinton took in at least $26 million to speak to organizations that have also donated to the foundation.  It s not surprising that organizations who believe strongly in the Clinton Foundation s mission and are impressed by its results are genuinely interested in President Clinton s perspective,  Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post at the time.   The president often says the foundation is his life today, and he welcomes any opportunity to educate people about it and encourage more people to work together to solve some of the most critical global challenges we all face.  In its analysis, the Post reported that among the approximately 420 organizations that paid Clinton to speak from 2001 to 2013, 67 of them also donated at least $10,000 each to the charity. The Russian uranium dealAs secretary of state, Clinton sat on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which had before it a request to approve the sale of U. S.  uranium stock to Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom as part of a transitioned takeover of a company which through an earlier merger had acquired U. S.  uranium interests. Following on Schweizer s research, The New York Times reported in April 2015 that Canadian businessman Frank Giustra had acquired uranium interests during a 2005 trip to Kazakhstan with Bill Clinton.  Giustra, whose up-and-coming UrAsia merged with the South African company Uranium One in 2007, gave more than $31 million to the foundation in 2006 and pledged $100 million more. Rosatom took over 17 percent of Uranium One in 2009, increasing to 51 percent in 2010 and the rest of the company in 2013.  Ian Telfer, who chaired Uranium One at the time of its acquisition by Rosatom, donated $2. 35 million in four separate gifts through his family foundation. "Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown," the Times reported in the article.  "But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation s donors. "The UBS dealThe Wall Street Journal reported last July that Hillary Clinton intervened on behalf of Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which the IRS was suing to get the identities of Americans with offshore accounts. After that intervention in 2009, donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation increased from less than $60,000 to a total of $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the Journal s report.  Additionally, the bank lent $32 million to the foundation to jump-start its entrepreneurship and inner-city loan program, and Bill Clinton received $1. 5 million to do question-and-answer sessions with UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Bob McCann. However, the Journal s report acknowledges that there is  no evidence of any link between Mrs.  Clinton s involvement in the case and the bank s donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, or its hiring of Mr.  Clinton,  while characterizing it as a  prime example of how the Clintons  private and political activities overlap.    Any suggestion that she was driven by anything but what s in America s best interest would be false.  Period,  a Clinton campaign spokesman told the Journal at the time. The foreign donationsAfter Clinton left office in 2013, the foundation lifted its ban on donations from foreign governments.  The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that recent donors to the foundation included the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, Germany and a Canadian government agency seeking the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. As recently as this month, Sanders seized upon the foreign donations in questioning in the judgment of Clinton to be commander in chief. "If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are dictatorships   yeah, I do," Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview aired June 5. Asked whether the foundation's ongoing activities presented an ongoing conflict of interest, Sanders responded, "Yes, I do. "Trump himself has openly boasted that Sanders' lines about Clinton's paid speeches would be useful fodder in a general election bout, even as the Vermont senator has vowed to do everything in his power to keep the presumptive Republican nominee from the White House. Five days before Clinton declared victory in the Democratic primary, Trump tweeted, "Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!"On Tuesday, the Trump campaign said the foundation had accepted between approximately $21. 3 million and $65. 5 million from the governments of countries with "policies hostile toward women's rights, gay rights and human rights," including Algeria, Brunei, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Friends of Saudi Arabia organization and the Zayeds, the ruling family of the Emirates. Promoting his "major speech," Trump told supporters on the night of the final Republican primaries, "I think you re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.  I wonder if the press will want to attend.  Who knows?"                 RNC member Bruce Ash rebuked the Never Trump movement in his party.   An influential Republican National Committee official is rebuking his own party, accusing it of empowering anti-Donald Trump figures to play key roles at this summer s convention   and, potentially, to dislodge Trump.  In a three-page letter sent to fellow RNC members, Bruce Ash, an Arizona Republican who oversees the committee s permanent Rules Committee, laces into the organization for appointing establishment-minded figures who, he says, could overturn Trump s nomination at the convention.  Ash s letter comes amid an intensifying push by anti-Trump delegates to implement a  conscience clause  on the first ballot that would allow delegates to unbind themselves from voting for Trump   thereby freeing themselves to throw their support to a  white knight  candidate who would take the nomination instead.  Specifically, Ash points to the RNC s appointments of committee members Ron Kaufman and Enid Mickelson (both of whom are close allies of Trump nemesis Mitt Romney) to oversee the convention s Rules Committee.  He also calls out the RNC for assigning establishment stalwart Haley Barbour to run the convention s Permanent Organization Committee.  (Kaufman, Mickelson and Barbour did not immediately respond to requests for comment. )  I stand by my analysis because I have concerns about the appointees who have worked with Romney in the past and despite well intentioned assurances, might possibly work to deny Trump the nomination he has earned.  I am a member of the convention rules committee and am entitled to my opinion,  writes Ash. He adds that he finds it  quite remarkable that the RNC might actually be leaning toward a vote to essentially invoke  a rule that would  reverse the results of the primary contests and unbind our delegates.   Ash goes on to suggest that the Trump campaign cut an ill-conceived deal with the RNC in hopes of fostering a relationship with the committee.  In recent weeks, there have been tensions between the two sides.   I m sure Mr.  Trump and campaign chairman Paul Manafort agreed to the appointments because they sought reconciliation and a merger with the RNC.  If this was part of the bargain then they had to deal with it.  However, it does not mean it was smart to sign off on this arrangement unless there are boundaries how we guarantee there will not be rules changes at convention rules which affect who our presumptive nominee is in 2016 after he received nearly 14,000,000 votes.    You might not agree with my words but you surely cannot fault my desire to stand up for millions of GOP voters who cast their vote for Donald Trump,  Ash adds.  Passing any unbinding rule remains unlikely.  To do so, it must be approved by a majority of the 112-member Rules Committee and then win a majority of support among the convention s 2,472 delegates.  Neither Ash nor an RNC spokesperson responded to a request for comment.  The Arizona Republican concludes the letter by writing:  We at the RNC must stand by our presumptive nominee s side and defend against all who would threaten our legitimacy as a national party.   Earlier this week, the Daily Caller published an item recounting Ash s appearance on a radio program in which he excoriated top Trump aides for allowing the Kaufman, Mickelson, and Barbour appointments to go through.  Trump s aides, Ash said, were  asleep at the switch.                   RNC member Bruce Ash rebuked the Never Trump movement in his party.

Undated photo or selfie of Omar Mateen, identified as the gunman in mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida on June 12.    A man who claimed to be the lover of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen said the June 12 massacre at a gay nightclub was motivated by revenge, not terrorism. In an interview with Univision, the man said Mateen was  100 percent gay  and that the two had carried on a  friends with benefits  relationship after meeting last year through a gay dating app.  He said he had reported his relationship with Mateen to the FBI and had been interviewed multiple times.  The FBI also confirmed to Univision that it has met with him. The man, who wore a disguise in his interview with Univision and was identified only as  Miguel,  said Mateen s attack at Orlando s Pulse nightclub was the result of a sexual encounter with two Latino men, one of which Mateen later discovered was HIV positive.  The attack, carried out at the nightclub s Latino night, was Mateen s attempt at taking revenge against a specific community of gay men who he felt had used and rejected him, the man said.  He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin, but he felt rejected.  He felt used by them.  There were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad.  Guys used him.  That really affected him,  Miguel told Univision.  "I believe this crazy horrible thing he did, that was revenge. "Miguel described Mateen as a  very sweet guy  who  loved to be cuddled  and frequented gay bars.  He said he was stunned when he discovered Mateen had been the shooter at Pulse, that it was  impossible that the man I know could do that.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said investigators are still looking into Mateen's contacts from the months leading up to the attack.  We stand with you to say that the good in this world far outweighs the evil, that our common humanity transcends our differences, and that our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, it s unity, and it s love,  Lynch told reporters, specifically addressing the LGBT community, on Tuesday.   We stand with you today as we grieve together, and long after the cameras are gone, we will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment, in solidarity, and in equality.

House Democrats, including Rep.  John Lewis (center), participate in a "sit-in" to demand a vote for gun control measures.   Photo by Rep.  Chillie Pingree via APDozens of House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor Wednesday in protest of the GOP leadership s refusal to allow a vote on a gun control measure following the Orlando massacre. Led by Reps.  John Lewis (D-Ga. ), the civil rights icon, and John Larson (D-Conn. ), more than 40 Democrats walked into the chamber just before noon and pledged to  occupy  the House floor until GOP leadership allowed a vote.  In one hour, their numbers more than tripled   even as Republicans recessed the House, turning off C-SPAN cameras and the video feed to the public. Democrats countered the TV camera blackout by streaming everything on their cellphones, which ended up on C-SPAN anyway. Democrats have tried numerous times over the past week to force a vote on a  no fly, no buy  bill, which would bar terror suspects on the  no-fly  list from purchasing guns.  The sit-in represented a sharp escalation in the fight, however, putting political pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ) to allow a roll-call vote on the policy issue that s gotten the most traction following the Florida shooting. But by early afternoon, there were no signs that Republicans would acquiesce to the Democrats  demands for a vote.  Republicans believe that if they give in now, it would encourage more such actions by Democrats, and one GOP leadership aide called the move a  Democrat publicity stunt.  But Democrats claim they will stay on the floor as long as it takes.  They want Ryan to cancel the mid-July recess to take up their proposal.  We have been too quiet for too long,  Lewis said.   There comes a time when you have to say something.  You have to make a little noise.  You have to move your feet.  This is the time.  How many more mothers? How many more fathers need to shed tears of grief before we do something?  Lewis continued, his voice rising in intensity.   Give us a vote.  Let us vote.  We came here to do our job.  We came here to work.  A short while later, Rep.  Jerry Nadler (D-N. Y. ) said the House  is drenched in blood and the only way we can cleanse it is if the speaker of the House allows us to vote on this legislation.  Every day that we don t commit to a vote, the blood is on the leadership of this House,  Nadler said. But Rep.  Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican, slammed the sit-in, tweeting that  calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworth s.  They sat in for rights.  Dems are  sitting in  to  strip them away.  Thank you John Lewis for leading on gun violence where we need it most.  https://t. co/vctfqAH5Wt  President Obama (@POTUS) June 22, 2016The protest seemed to catch Republicans off guard.  As another House Democrat prepared to speak after Lewis, the GOP lawmaker presiding over the chamber suddenly declared the House was in recess and shut off microphones.  The cameras followed since, technically, the House was not in session. Democrats, including Reps.  Joe Crowley of New York, Donna Edwards of Maryland and Alcee Hastings of Florida, meanwhile, sat down on the floor or stood by the front podium.  They began reading the names of those who died in the June 12 shooting at a Florida nightclub that left 49 dead and 53 wounded.  No bill, no break,  they chanted, repeating recent demands that House GOP leaders cancel the upcoming House recess until they vote on gun control. Members took turns speaking, backed up by chants and applause.  We ve had it.  We re not going to watch any more people in this country get slaughtered and do nothing!  Rep.  Mike Doyle (D-Pa. ) yelled during the protest.  Break the shackles!  Rep.  Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said at another point. Rep.  Maxine Waters (D-Calif. ) taunted Republicans, saying they  don t have the guts to stand up to the gun lobby.  Lawmakers tweeted their protest, posting pictures online, and Rep.  Scott Peters (D-Calif. ) started streaming the sit-in live on the Periscope app. As the number of Democrats on the floor grew, staffers brought in cases of bottled water, Coca-Cola and Diet Coke to the Democratic cloakroom.  One Democratic member said the protest could stretch through the evening and possibly into Thursday. s lost, those families destroyed, those communities that have been broken because of our refusal to speak up, stand up and support just laws that will ensure safety and security,  Clyburn said. Just Tuesday, when Clyburn unsuccessfully tried to force a vote on the same issue during a House vote, Republicans rejected his attempts. Sen.  Chris Murphy (D-Conn. ), who led the 15-hour filibuster in the Senate last week, showed up to encourage Democrats.  His filibuster had forced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) to hold a series of votes on gun measures, though none cleared that chamber. The Democrats cheered him, vowing to sit in the chamber until they forced a vote in their own chamber, too.  I hope they stay in there for as long as it takes, through the day, through the night, until they get a vote,  Murphy said. Republicans showed no signs of bowing to Democrats  demand.  The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair,  AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis. ), said in a statement. Some Democrats carried their protest outside, gathering on the Capitol steps to double down on their demands. With the sun blazing, party leaders took turns speaking as rank-and-file Democrats and gun violence protesters stood behind them, some wearing  We are Orlando  shirts and others holding up pictures of gun violence victims.  Donald Trump ripped into Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, painting her as a corrupt career politician who he said would enrich her allies and cater to special interests at the expense of the American people. In an address where he rarely strayed from his prepared remarks, Trump accused the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic nominee of being a "world-class liar" who "may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. "Pointing to her past debunked claims about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in the 1990s and her "pathetic email and server statements," Trump accused Clinton of corrupting America's economy, foreign policy and national security. "When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me," Trump said from his Trump SoHo development in New York City, according to his prepared remarks.  (Mexico is connected by land to the United States. )Trump also looked to grow his coalition, and cut into Clinton's, with messaging that echoes elements of Bernie Sanders' appeal to voters.  Trump ripped his rival's support of trade deals   a frequent target of Sanders   while also promising to create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.  And, in a near-verbatim lifting of Sanders' message, Trump complained of a system that's "rigged" against the American people. In contrast, Clinton "has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft," Trump said. "She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and really, many, many others, in exchange for cash," Trump said   allegation Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied.  "Pure and simple, folks, Pure and simple.  Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   and in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public.  I wonder why. ""Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001," Trump said.  "They totally own her, and that will never change including if she ever became president, God help us. "Clinton does not have the temperament, "or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office," Trump said. "Her campaign slogan is 'I m with her. ' You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people," Trump said to applause.  "She thinks it s all about her.  I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. "Trump used details from "Clinton Cash," the 2015 book by conservative operative Peter Schweizer, to hammer home his points.  The Clinton campaign has trashed the book as "false, right-wing attacks" funded by the Koch brothers, and it continued to push back on Trump's attacks Wednesday afternoon.  The only thing Donald Trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories.  This is more distraction from a candidate that cannot answer or dispute any of yesterday s criticism of his business record," Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement.  "Economists on the left, right and center all agree his dangerous economic policies would throw us back into recession and hurt working families costing nearly 3. 5 million American jobs, that s a fact.  Donald Trump continues to prove that he is unqualified and unfit to be president.  Just like he shouldn t have his finger on the button, he shouldn t have his hands on our economy.  The AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Clinton, only went so far as to give Trump credit for having "recognized some of the challenges working people have known for decades," Josh Goldstein, deputy national media director said, "but the truth is he doesn t have a clue how to fix our problems, he would only make them worse. Hammering the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the governments of countries with hostile policies toward women and gays, as well as claiming that Clinton's immigration policy "wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. ""To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server," Trump alleged   though the department has said only that the server setup violated its records-keeping policies, while the FBI has yet to determine if there was any crime involved. "Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China, I'm sure they have it   putting all of America in danger," Trump continued.  "Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.  We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. "He continued, "National security is also immigration security   and Hillary wants neither. ""Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States," Trump said.  "She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders. "Trump also alleged that Clinton "managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East" as secretary of state claiming that the Islamic State " threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. "Hitting Clinton for her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq, Trump reiterated his claim that he "was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. "However, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept.  11, 2002, "yeah, I guess so" and "I wish the first time it was done correctly" when asked his position, as BuzzFeed News surfaced in February. "But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya," Trump said, in reference to her advocacy for the 2011 intervention that knocked out Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Trump aimed high with his concluding remarks, vowing to offer a bigger, better future for the country than Clinton. "Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change.  My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it," he said.  " This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that s not who we are.  "Vowing to "build the greatest infrastructure on planet Earth" and ensure the military "will have the best technology and finest equipment," Trump promised "massive new factories" that will "come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. ""Construction is what I know," he said.  "I say, nobody knows it better. " Remarks as prepared for delivery.  Today I d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election. People have asked me why I am running for President. I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day. We come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big, and then we make it happen. I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton   only by me. The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.  But we can t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them. We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That s why we re asking Bernie Sanders  voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.  Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it s not just the political system that s rigged.  It s the whole economy. It s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U. S.  with absolutely no consequences for them. It s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It s rigged against you, the American people. Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie. Brian Williams  career was destroyed for saying far less. Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.  But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.  I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.  That is a talent our country desperately needs. I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first. We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians. Here is my promise to the American voter:If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D. C. The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests   and taking money from special interests. Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund   doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash. Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests   in less than 2 years   secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never change. The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control. Those are the stakes. Hillary Clinton wants to be President.  But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president. She believes she is entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is  I m with her.  You know what my response to that is? I m with you: the American people. She thinks it s all about her. I know it s all about you   I know it s all about making America Great Again for All Americans. Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism   focusing on what s good for America s middle class   to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy. We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs. We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again. That s what we mean by America First. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores. Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for  the encouragement and protection of manufacturing  in America. Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China s entrance into the World Trade Organization. We ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned. Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property   a crime which is continuing to this day. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America s expense. She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book:  At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States. She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas   and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.  She has even deleted this record of total support from her book   deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing. )But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.  She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career   and it will be even worse than the Clintons  NAFTA deal. I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers. We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president. It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars   and unleashed ISIS across the world. No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.  He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security. Hillary Clinton s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death. Here is what one of the victim s mothers had to say: I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don t want this person to be president.  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel. ISIS wasn t even on the map. Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen   while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.  The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora s box of radical Islam. Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality   and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short, Hillary Clinton s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticizethe rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started. But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power,she couldn t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office: She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to servein the office from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true Her leadership style   volcanic, impulsive disdainful of the rules set for everyone else   hasn t changed a bit.  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number. Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth   with no way to screen who they are or what they believe. Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U. S. The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of themost repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth. I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslavedand gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. Here is some more of what we learned from the book,Clinton Cash:A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.  So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.  The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions. Hillary Clinton s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access   even though he had no national security credentials. Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State   plus millions more for her foundation.  The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.  The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death. Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens. To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments   perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China   putting all of America in danger. Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do. So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States. This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency. We can t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. National security is also immigration security  and Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United StatesThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.  They are the ones she will hurt the most. Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton. Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here is an excerpt from Mrs.  Mendoza s letter: Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms  way   an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country.  Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.  She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.  Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration. For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. Hillary s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.  She can t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workersto compete against them. Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days: Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.  Hillary Clinton s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment. Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster. Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs. Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State. There is one common theme in all of these reforms. It s going to be America First. This is why the stakes in November are so great. On election day, the politicians stand trial before the people. The voters are the jury.  Their ballots are the verdict.  We don t need or want another Clinton or Obama. Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold outtheir country. They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton s message is old and tired.  Her message is that can t change. My message is that things have to change   and this is our one chance do it.  This is our last chance to do it. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more. Then we started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose, and daring. But that s not who we are. Come this November, we can bring America back   bigger and better, and stronger than ever. We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth   the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow. Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment   we will bring it back all the way. Massive new factories will come roaring into our country   breathing life and hope into our communities. Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better. The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.  Hillary s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone. We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do. I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices. Our country is going to start working again. People are going to start working again. Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again   including parents in our inner cities. Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country. We are going to make America rich again. We are going to make America safe again. We are going to make America Great Again   and Great Again For EVERYONE.  In a complete about-face, Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio officially announced an eleventh-hour reelection bid Wednesday, making him the instant front-runner in a key battleground state and lifting Republican hopes that they can hang on to the U. S.  Senate. The first-term senator told POLITICO he knows he faces a tough race in a state with a history of close elections and where opponents on the right and left accuse him of rank political opportunism for breaking his pledge to retire from the Senate if he didn t win his presidential race this year. Rubio said the election is too important to miss since the GOP could potentially lose the Senate majority.  And in a sign he recognizes the damage his party s de facto presidential nominee could do to his bid, Rubio said he wouldn t hesitate to criticize Donald Trump when he makes inflammatory statements or advocates ideas he disagrees with.  It s been well-documented that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump on his failure to articulate policies and many of the things that he has said, especially about women and minorities,  Rubio said in the interview, mentioning Trump s name unprompted.   And so, I m prepared to be a senator that will encourage him to make the right decisions, but also stand up to the bad decisions and the bad policies if he s elected president.  Rubio didn t shy away from knocking Trump for drawing attention to the Mexican heritage of an Indiana-born judge who s presiding over a case against Trump University.  All I can tell you is that they re not comments that I agree with.  They went beyond the pale.  I think that that judge is fully American and his experience is not unlike mine,  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said when asked about Trump s comments. Rubio made clear, though, that he believes Hillary Clinton would be worse than Trump:  He s not running against George Washington.  Rubio has had a fraught relationship with Trump, who thrashed him so badly in Florida s March 15 presidential primary that he withdrew from the race.  Rubio apologized for making suggestive comments about the size of Trump s genitalia on the campaign trail and followed through with his commitment to back Trump, who urged Rubio to run for reelection. But Trump s campaign has sputtered as his poll numbers have begun to drop in Florida, where Republicans fear he ll drag down other candidates.  Rubio, they say, might be the only candidate in their party with the name ID and rhetorical wherewithal to withstand down-ballot problems if Trump collapses in November. Still, it s a delicate balancing act for Rubio, who doesn t want to estrange the legions of loyal Trump voters who voted against the senator in the primary. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that Florida s general-election voters view the two Republicans in vastly different ways. Trump, once virtually tied with Clinton, is now trailing her by 8 points in the poll.  Rubio, though, leads his Democratic opponents, House members Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, by 7 and 8 points, respectively. Still, Democrats tried to see the glass as half full.  Presidential election years tend to bring out more Democratic voters, and Trump has been reeling.  Democrats believe if they can hand Rubio his second defeat in a year, it would make him damaged goods and potentially close off a 2020 White House bid. Rubio was characteristically confident, though.  He dismissed Murphy, the favorite of national Democrats, as a spoiled rich kid.  He has no significant achievements in his entire life,  Rubio said.   He has been handed everything, from the moment he was born: his first job, his second job.  And now his family and his father want to buy him a Senate seat.  As for Grayson, Rubio singled out a House ethics investigation and said,  The chances are, he would probably be indicted in his first couple years in office.  Murphy and Grayson have attacked Rubio for his positions on gay rights and guns, and for breaking his pledge not to run for reelection.  Before facing either of them, Rubio still has to win his Aug.  30 primary against political newcomer Carlos Beruff, who bashed Rubio as the choice of Washington power brokers. Rubio hit back in the interview by pointing out that Beruff had backed his 2010 Senate-race opponent, Gov.  Charlie Crist, after the then-governor left the GOP.  He ll have to answer for that,  Rubio said. Beruff said Rubio needs to explain why he broke his word and whether he ll commit to a full six-year Senate term. Asked whether he d run for president in four years, Rubio said:  You know what? I m done.  I m done making statements like that one way or another.  Rubio acknowledged that the race for him was made even more difficult because he decided at the last minute and he has to explain to voters why he changed his mind.  I m aware of the political arguments of this.  You re running for reelection when you said you wouldn t in the most unusual national political cycle in modern American history, in the most competitive state in the country, against a well-funded Democrat and other Republicans saying they re going to run,  he said. Rubio seriously began entertaining a reelection bid after the Orlando shootings on June 12, when his friend and favored successor, Lt.  Gov.  Carlos Lopez-Cantera, said the senator should give it a second look.  Lopez-Cantera was struggling with fundraising and was stagnant in the polls.  He dropped out of the race with Rubio s entry and praised the senator.  U. S.  Rep.  Ron DeSantis also quit the Senate race Wednesday and announced his reelection bid for the 6th Congressional District.  Businessman Todd Wilcox said he s staying in the race along with Beruff. Rubio pushed back against the notion that he s running for reelection because he wants to run for president.  His plan to retire   and make a small fortune in the private sector   was geared around running for president as early as 2020.  By being in the Senate, Rubio and his aides say, he knows he ll have to take votes or miss votes that will be held against him if he runs for president again. Of course, it will also give him a bigger platform and media spotlight than he d have in South Florida. Lopez-Cantera disputed the talk of a secret long-term political deal between the two.  He said he actually felt guilty because he put the  burden  on Rubio to run for the seat.  This was a selfless act,  Lopez-Cantera said.   He could have started focusing on his family and their future well-being.  Rather than plotting out a Senate bid, Rubio said, he spent weekends over the past two months planning to become the defensive coach for his son s sixth-grade football team and  designing this, if I do say so myself, pretty good defense.  I was going to get to coach my son directly because he plays safety.  I was really excited about that,  Rubio added.   I know that s kind of a small thing for people outside of it.  But for me, that was a pretty big deal.  My son will never be in sixth grade again.  In contrast, there was no Senate campaign to speak of.  Only in recent days did Rubio begin reaching out to donors (he might need as much as $50 million) and his departed presidential campaign staffers to see whether they were ready to help out. Clint Reed, Iowa director for Rubio s presidential campaign, will be his campaign manager, and Rubio s longtime consultant, Todd Harris, will serve as a strategic adviser.  Rubio s presidential campaign spokesman, Alex Conant, and campaign manager Terry Sullivan could work for the campaign or with a super PAC.  Conservative Solutions, the super PAC formed to help Rubio s presidential bid, was in the process of winding down when Rubio began considering his reelection. The senator s decision to run was widely hailed by Washington and Florida GOP elites who see him as their best hope to keep his seat.  They had lobbied Rubio for months to reconsider his pledge to retire in January if he lost his White House bid. Top Republican leaders said that Rubio s entry into the race upends the Senate map and may force Democrats to commit far more money to the contest.  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said Rubio will  have a lot of support  from the party and Florida donors. The decision was so important to Republicans that even notoriously tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell held an impromptu gaggle to celebrate.  McConnell said Rubio s decision moved the seat from a  likely loss to an almost certain  hold.  It has a huge impact on our ability to hold the majority, so it s a big development,  McConnell said.   I m just glad Marco had a chance to reassess the job he currently had.    I m pretty excited about it.  But Rubio s fellow Florida senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, indicated that Wicker doesn t realize how toxic Trump will be in the general election. Nelson said he and Rubio  get along real well,  but  I think that his biggest problem is that Hillary is going to swamp the top of the ticket and that will have a down-ballot effect.  I think Hillary is going to sweep Florida so big that it s gonna affect all the way down the ballot.  Rubio said he s keenly aware of the risks of running for reelection and losing twice in a year   especially in an unpredictable election season like this.  I understand this was going to be a difficult race whether I announced two weeks ago or two days before qualifying,  Rubio said.   It s Florida.  General election.  Very unusual top of the ticket situation for both parties.  It s going to be tough either way.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.  John McCain is running for reelection like it s 2010. The Arizona Republican has made his opposition to Obamacare   which dominated Senate races across the country six years ago   a central point of his campaign, by all accounts, the toughest reelection fight of his career.  He s betting that shrinking coverage options and premium increases that could go as high as 65 percent if insurers get their way will resonate with Arizona voters, even as most of his Republican colleagues running this year have moved on to other issues. The issue helps him run to the right of his GOP primary opponent, while also taking a direct shot at his Democratic opponent, Rep.  Ann Kirkpatrick, who called her 2010 vote for the law the one she s  most proud about.    I think it s a very strong issue,  McCain told POLITICO about his focus on Obamacare.   Eight of the counties in my state will now only have one health insurer.  They re staring at 65 percent increases in their premiums.  They re very upset.  That s a different strategy than the one McCain s colleagues are employing.  GOP Sens.  Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson all won their seats in 2010 by promising to oppose President Barack Obama s recently passed health care law, but they ve hardly mentioned it in their reelection campaigns this year.  Instead, their TV spots have focused on national security, the economy and the opioid epidemic.  None of them, however, face a serious primary opponent and only Johnson is running against a Democrat who was in Congress in 2010. Brad Todd, a veteran Republican media consultant, sees the lack of Obamacare-focused ads as a missed opportunity.   I think it has been completely overlooked this cycle by too many campaigns,  he said.   It is less popular today than it ever was.  He s betting campaigns will start messaging on it eventually.   I really think you ll end up seeing it in every race,  Todd added. Putting the president s law front and center is a double-edged sword, though.  This year marks the first presidential cycle in which most of the law s benefits   insurance coverage that started in 2014   have been in effect.  There are millions of consumers who have gotten life-saving insurance coverage and worry about losing it under a GOP repeal plan.  But there s been no shortage of news stories about rising premiums and consumers who didn t realize how much they d have to pay for ACA plans.  And polls show that the law has not gotten more popular, as Democrats predicted it would once coverage rolled out.  Six years ago, many of the most vulnerable Republicans in this cycle rode into office by bashing the recently approved health care law.  And it worked   Republicans increased their numbers in the Senate and flipped control of the House.  Kirkpatrick was one of the House Democrats who lost her seat in the Republican wave. This cycle, McCain s Republican colleagues are focusing instead on the economy, or the worsening heroin and opioid addiction crises gripping their states.  New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been hit particularly hard by the epidemic. Portman of Ohio, for instance, has run four separate spots touting his efforts to fight heroin and opioid addiction in the state, including an emotional 60-second promotion.   He gives as much time and energy and love to this as any of us parents who have lost,  one Ohio parent, Tonda DaRe, says in the ad. McCain, however, may have more reason to focus on Obamacare than his Republican colleagues. In Arizona, two insurance companies   UnitedHealth and Humana   plan to leave the state s Obamacare exchange next year.  Blue Cross Blue Shield, which will be the only option for customers in eight counties, has asked state regulators to approve an average rate hike of 65 percent.  Most other insurers on the exchange have asked for double-digit rate increases, too.  Late last year, the state s co-op insurance plan went belly up, sending 60,000 customers looking for new coverage.  Obamacare is failing Arizonans,  the narrator says in McCain s first TV ad, which started airing last month.   First, a massive rate hike   more than twice the national average.  Then America s largest health insurer abandoned Arizona s failing Obamacare exchange.    Congresswoman Kirkpatrick bragged about her Obamacare vote,  the narrator continues, as the clip plays of Kirkpatrick calling the vote the one she s  most proud about.  The bad Obamacare headlines aren t unique to Arizona, but McCain has been most aggressive about using them.  The McCain folks have tapped into a serious concern in the marketplace.  They ve got real numbers   it s not theoretical," said Tom Miller, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  "He s got a very tough race, a changing electorate, he has to deal with the Trump stuff   this allows him to say something a little more aggressive and be on the attack.  McCain has also taken other steps to shore up his anti-Obamacare bona fides.  In recent months, he s given several Senate floor speeches against it and issued statements responding to every piece of bad news on the law.  He s also tried to blunt likely attacks from Kirkpatrick supporters that Arizonians would lose their coverage if the law were repealed by introducing a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. Kirkpatrick s campaign says it isn t worried about McCain s Obamacare offensive.  While Kirkpatrick lost her seat in 2010 after voting for the ACA, she regained it in 2012 and held onto it in 2014   a year when many other Democrats in swing districts were swept away.  Outside groups and national Republicans have spent millions and millions against Ann" over the years attacking her over her vote for Obamacare, D. B.  Mitchell, a Kirkpatrick spokesman, wrote in an email.   But Ann's continued to win a Republican district despite these attacks.  While the ads call out Kirkpatrick, they re also an effective attack against former state Sen.  Kelli Ward, an osteopath who s challenging McCain from the right in the primary.  In an interview, Ward said she commends McCain for attacking Kirkpatrick on the law   but she doesn t think he s the most reliable messenger.  It is a little disingenuous on Sen.  McCain s part,  Ward said.   He called the very senators who want to stop it  Sen.  Paul, Sen.  Cruz and Sen.  Lee    wacko birds.    McCain used the phrase for Paul, Cruz and Rep.  Justin Amash of Michigan in 2013 after Paul filibustered in an attempt to block confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director.  Paul, Cruz and Lee later led a failed effort to defund Obamacare that caused a partial government shutdown.  John McCain is running for reelection like it s 2010. The Arizona Republican has made his opposition to Obamacare   which dominated Senate races across the country six years ago   a central point of his campaign, by all accounts, the toughest reelection fight of his career.  He s betting that shrinking coverage options and premium increases that could go as high as 65 percent if insurers get their way will resonate with Arizona voters, even as most of his Republican colleagues running this year have moved on to other issues. The issue helps him run to the right of his GOP primary opponent, while also taking a direct shot at his Democratic opponent, Rep.  Ann Kirkpatrick, who called her 2010 vote for the law the one she s  most proud about.    I think it s a very strong issue,  McCain told POLITICO about his focus on Obamacare.   Eight of the counties in my state will now only have one health insurer.  They re staring at 65 percent increases in their premiums.  They re very upset.  That s a different strategy than the one McCain s colleagues are employing.  GOP Sens.  Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson all won their seats in 2010 by promising to oppose President Barack Obama s recently passed health care law, but they ve hardly mentioned it in their reelection campaigns this year.  Instead, their TV spots have focused on national security, the economy and the opioid epidemic.  None of them, however, face a serious primary opponent and only Johnson is running against a Democrat who was in Congress in 2010. Brad Todd, a veteran Republican media consultant, sees the lack of Obamacare-focused ads as a missed opportunity.   I think it has been completely overlooked this cycle by too many campaigns,  he said.   It is less popular today than it ever was.  He s betting campaigns will start messaging on it eventually.   I really think you ll end up seeing it in every race,  Todd added. Putting the president s law front and center is a double-edged sword, though.  This year marks the first presidential cycle in which most of the law s benefits   insurance coverage that started in 2014   have been in effect.  There are millions of consumers who have gotten life-saving insurance coverage and worry about losing it under a GOP repeal plan.  But there s been no shortage of news stories about rising premiums and consumers who didn t realize how much they d have to pay for ACA plans.  And polls show that the law has not gotten more popular, as Democrats predicted it would once coverage rolled out.  Six years ago, many of the most vulnerable Republicans in this cycle rode into office by bashing the recently approved health care law.  And it worked   Republicans increased their numbers in the Senate and flipped control of the House.  Kirkpatrick was one of the House Democrats who lost her seat in the Republican wave. This cycle, McCain s Republican colleagues are focusing instead on the economy, or the worsening heroin and opioid addiction crises gripping their states.  New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been hit particularly hard by the epidemic. Portman of Ohio, for instance, has run four separate spots touting his efforts to fight heroin and opioid addiction in the state, including an emotional 60-second promotion.   He gives as much time and energy and love to this as any of us parents who have lost,  one Ohio parent, Tonda DaRe, says in the ad. McCain, however, may have more reason to focus on Obamacare than his Republican colleagues. In Arizona, two insurance companies   UnitedHealth and Humana   plan to leave the state s Obamacare exchange next year.  Blue Cross Blue Shield, which will be the only option for customers in eight counties, has asked state regulators to approve an average rate hike of 65 percent.  Most other insurers on the exchange have asked for double-digit rate increases, too.  Late last year, the state s co-op insurance plan went belly up, sending 60,000 customers looking for new coverage.  Obamacare is failing Arizonans,  the narrator says in McCain s first TV ad, which started airing last month.   First, a massive rate hike   more than twice the national average.  Then America s largest health insurer abandoned Arizona s failing Obamacare exchange.    Congresswoman Kirkpatrick bragged about her Obamacare vote,  the narrator continues, as the clip plays of Kirkpatrick calling the vote the one she s  most proud about.  The bad Obamacare headlines aren t unique to Arizona, but McCain has been most aggressive about using them.  The McCain folks have tapped into a serious concern in the marketplace.  They ve got real numbers   it s not theoretical," said Tom Miller, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  "He s got a very tough race, a changing electorate, he has to deal with the Trump stuff   this allows him to say something a little more aggressive and be on the attack.  McCain has also taken other steps to shore up his anti-Obamacare bona fides.  In recent months, he s given several Senate floor speeches against it and issued statements responding to every piece of bad news on the law.  He s also tried to blunt likely attacks from Kirkpatrick supporters that Arizonians would lose their coverage if the law were repealed by introducing a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. Kirkpatrick s campaign says it isn t worried about McCain s Obamacare offensive.  While Kirkpatrick lost her seat in 2010 after voting for the ACA, she regained it in 2012 and held onto it in 2014   a year when many other Democrats in swing districts were swept away.  Outside groups and national Republicans have spent millions and millions against Ann" over the years attacking her over her vote for Obamacare, D. B.

Paul, Cruz and Lee later led a failed effort to defund Obamacare that caused a partial government shutdown.                  "It s not about Harriet Tubman, it s about keeping the picture on the $20," Steve King said, pulling out a $20 bill  and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.   The House will not vote to block the inclusion of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, dodging a politically charged vote for GOP lawmakers. Rep.  Steve King (R-Iowa) had filed an amendment to a bill funding the Treasury Department to prohibit the department from redesigning any currency to showcase the abolitionist icon, but the Rules Committee denied floor consideration of the proposal Tuesday night. "It's not about Harriet Tubman, it's about keeping the picture on the $20," King said Tuesday evening, pulling a $20 bill from his pocket and pointing at President Andrew Jackson.  "Y'know? Why would you want to change that? I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have. "The conservative gadfly said it is "racist" and "sexist" to say a woman or person of color should be added to currency.  "Here's what's really happening: This is liberal activism on the part of the president that's trying to identify people by categories, and he's divided us on the lines of groups.  . . .  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine's unifying.  It says just don't change anything. "The Treasury Department announced in April that it would move the image of Jackson to the back of the $20 note, replacing him with Tubman, a former slave who helped other slaves escape to freedom and served with the Union Army during the Civil War.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also announced plans to redesign $5 and $10 bills to include leaders from the women's rights and civil rights movements.  Neither Abraham Lincoln nor Alexander Hamilton would be removed from their spots on the front of the $5 and $10 notes. King is not alone among Republicans opposed to placing the abolitionist and civil rights icon on the $20 bill.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in April that the move was "pure political correctness" and recommended that an image of Tubman be placed on the $2 bill. Amendments to appropriations bills have proven troublesome to Republicans in recent weeks.  After a Democratic amendment to prohibit discrimination by federal contractors against LGBT people was added to a bill funding energy and water programs, Republicans dropped their support for the measure, and it was defeated.  That kerfuffle led Speaker Paul Ryan to go back on his commitment to allow for an open amendment process and instead limit which amendments could be considered. The Rules Committee blocked consideration of the LGBT amendment, as it has in recent weeks.  The willingness of the GOP-controlled panel to stymie a fellow Republican, particularly amid conservative frustration with a limited amendment process, demonstrates the desire to avoid controversial votes in an election year. King, for his part, saw the amendment as crucial. "President Obama's on his way out the door," he said.  "He's going to do everything he can think of to upset this society and this civilization. "  House Republicans on a powerful spending committee rejected an amendment to limit the sale of firearms to terrorist suspects Wednesday, just days after Senate Republicans blocked an identical amendment on the chamber floor.  This policy could have made areal difference in Orlando,  said Rep.  Nita Lowey (D-N. Y. ), who introduced the amendment during a House Appropriations Committee mark up.  The measure would block firearms purchases by those who the Attorney General has a  reasonable suspicion  are engaged in terrorism. Republicans said the provision would violate due process rights for those seeking to buy firearms.  Democrats fired back by reciting the names and stories of some of the 49 victims of the June 12 massacre in Orlando, arguing that new gun controls are the best way to stop future bloodshed. After pointed back-and-forth, the measure was defeated, 16-31.  This list has been faulted for producing a high error rate in the past,  said Rep.  John Carter (R-Texas) of the terror watch list, urging his colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I cannot support a standard that is so inherently subjective, especially when it is used to deny a constitutional right.   But Democrats focused on the stories of some of Omar Mateen's victims in Orlando. Lowey spoke about Shane Tomlinson, 33, who was from her district.  He made everyone around him better.  His life was cut far too short,  she said.   He will be sorely missed but not forgotten.   Rep.  Jose Serrano (D-N. Y. ) spoke about Jonathan Antonio Camuy Vega, 24.  He had his whole life ahead of him,  Serrano said.   All his hopes, his dreams, his life gone in an instant.   Some Republican members compared the proposed measure to the internment of Japanese citizens by the US government during WWII, addressing such comparisons to Rep.  Mike Honda (D-Cal. ), who spent time in such an internment camp with his family.   Your liberty should never have been denied, and we shouldn t deny people s Second Amendment rights either,  Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) said to Honda, who disputed the comparison.   The government, I think, said they had  reasonable suspicion,  and therefore you were denied some rights, on the basis of  reasonable suspicion,   appropriations chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky. ) said to Honda, arguing that such "reasonable suspicion" should not be allowed to deny the right to purchase firearm. Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats for trampling on the constitution. Rep.  John Culberson (R-Texas) slammed the measure as taking away  one of the most fundamental rights Americans have.  Rep.  Andy Harris (R-Md. ) called the right to own a firearm  almost the definition of personal liberty.   I d rather my child be inconvenienced than dead,  Lowey said forcefully moments before the vote.  President Barack Obama endorsed LinkedIn as a job search tool Monday, joking that he would use the professional social media network to seek employment after he leaves the White House. America is  an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama said, after ticking through a list of facts that support that statement. As he frequently does when speaking to younger people, Obama made the case that if given the choice to live in any era   not knowing what your gender, ethnicity or class would be    you would choose right now.   You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history,  he said in his keynote address at the Washington Hilton for the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit.   Less violent.  Less driven by division.  You d choose today.  Obama touted the country s steady rate of private sector job growth, high school graduation rate, percentage of Americans insured under Obamacare, slow growth of health care costs and  high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field.   Our rule of law, our mature capital markets   all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business,  Obama added.   Now that s a pretty good sales pitch.  I don t mind being America s pitchman, and in seven months or so   in seven months or so, I ll be on the job market, and I m glad I m gonna be here.  I m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.  In February, the president posted on LinkedIn about his first summer job scooping ice cream to announce a summer job initiative for young people.  My first summer job wasn t exactly glamorous, but it taught me some valuable lessons.  Responsibility.  Hard work.  Balancing a job with friends, family, and school,  Obama wrote.   We re kicking off a Summer Opportunity Project that brings together state and local leaders, community organizations, schools, and businesses   including LinkedIn   to get young people into their first jobs and create strong transitions between school years and from high school to college and careers.   They knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.  Donald Trump's newly released fundraising figures proved so anemic that Republican operatives are still shaking their heads and rubbing their eyes to make sure they read the numbers correctly.  The presumptive Republican nominee   who frequently boasts about his vast personal fortune   reported a paltry $1. 3 million cash on hand Monday evening, a total not even in the same ballpark as Hillary Clinton s $42. 5 million.  "It's low for a Senate race, much less a presidential race," said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who formerly worked for Sen.  Marco Rubio.  "I have a state Senate client that has more in the bank," said another GOP operative formerly aligned with Rubio s campaign.  The number was "almost so low that it's not even comprehendable. " After enduring an evening of Twitter mockery over his lack of cash, Trump on Tuesday moved to remedy his situation by sending out the campaign s first fundraising email   with an all-caps subject line reading "THE FIRST ONE. " Republicans already worry it may be too little, too late.  "Republicans have been hoping that the Trump team would put together an organized fundraising effort, and in mid-May they were saying the right things about bringing in experienced bundlers and donors to lead a victory effort," said Charlie Spies, a former Republican National Committee counsel.  "This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure.  It's not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign. " By insisting on his ability to self-fund during the primary, Trump failed to build the kind of fundraising base that will enable him to compete on an even playing field with Clinton, said Eric Tanenblatt, a member of House Speaker Paul Ryan's finance team and former Jeb Bush supporter.  "I was very involved in Mitt Romney's fundraising effort in 2008, and immediately after he got out of the primary he got his team together and he said we all need to get behind John McCain, and I ended up raising more money that year for John McCain than I did for Mitt Romney by the time the election ended," Tanenblatt said.  "There wasn't that effort with regard to the Trump campaign because the Trump campaign didn't raise money on their own and didn't reach out to supporters of the other candidates like donors are accustomed.  Typically, the nominee is the one who is magnanimous and reaches out to the supporters of the other campaigns and unifies and works to unify the party.  I don't think that happened to the extent it should have. "Defending his campaign's financial situation on Tuesday, Trump pointed out that he could simply reach into his own wallet "if needs be. ""There could be unlimited 'cash on hand,' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars," Trump said in a statement, referring to the approximate amount he has lent to his campaign.  "Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.  Still, those who worked for Trump's vanquished rivals, while fretting that Clinton s war chest so dramatically eclipses Trump's, were unable to resist the temptation to knock the real estate mogul's funding strategy.  "I thought he was self funding? ;)," a chief strategist for one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump early in the GOP primary wrote in an email.  Several Republicans argued that it's unlikely that the GOP donor class will make a mad rush to close the money gap between Clinton and Trump, since there's still a strong distaste for Trump among some donors.  Those feelings go both ways: One Republican donor who recently met with then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recalled him suggesting that Trump strongly disliked asking major GOP donors for money. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "Most of the donors that have been loyal Republican supporters over the past few election cycles have been vilified by Trump, and he said that he could win without them and was going to self-fund, so they're not inspired to jump on board with significant donations," said Spies.  "What would possibly move them to support him would be across-the-board enthusiasm about the nominee or a bandwagon effect.  I mean, if all your friends are giving, you don't want to be left out, but this number is an indication that none of your friends are giving, so why would you be the guy out front supporting Trump when nobody else is?"A former bundler for Jeb Bush was even more direct about his disinterest in helping Trump.  "This is a guy who lent himself $30 million or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back.  This is a total fraud.  He's a fraud," the former Bush bundler said, referring to the fact that Trump loaned his campaign the cash and could still repay himself.  "There's a universe of, I don't know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who's not going to contribute.  So that's part of it.  And I think we're just not going to stick our necks out for that.  This isn't a situation like Ben Carson, where he's blowing through money like nobody's business.  I don't think that s blowing through tons of money.  They didn't have a huge staff to begin with.  They're not fully staffed to run a national campaign. "The question now, Tanenblatt said, is what Trump does going forward in terms of picking a vice-presidential candidate and what he says in public.  That could determine whether his fundraising picks up or not.  "I think that says a lot about him as a candidate,  Tanenblatt said.   That's probably the biggest decision that he's going to make in the campaign, so that will send a signal. " David Tamasi, a former fundraiser for New Jersey Gov.  Chris Christie's presidential campaign, stressed that it's still a long way until Election Day, and he said Republicans shouldn t read too much into May fundraising numbers.  "It's easy to look at May and compare that to somebody who's had a 25-year start to make some sort of comparison, none of which are flattering, but I think it's an inaccurate portrayal of where things will be once things get hot," Tamasi said.

Corey Lewandowski had fought his way back from the brink of termination at least twice over the past few months, utilizing a no-holds-barred style of infighting seldom seen in presidential politics while relying on the loyalty of a small group of allies and an unusually close relationship with his boss.  But Lewandowski s survival strategy began to backfire this month.  And by the time he was called into one of the executive offices at Donald Trump s campaign headquarters in Manhattan s Trump Tower on Monday morning for the final time as campaign manager, the once-obscure GOP operative had run out of lifelines.  He d grown increasingly reckless in his power struggle, taking on the candidate s own family and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  He d already told associates more than once in the past few months that he was on the verge of quitting, and some of his allies had either backed away from him or quit the campaign.  So when Lewandowski was informed in a meeting with Trump s adult children that he was being relieved of his dream job running the first-time candidate s presidential campaign, the career GOP operative didn t argue.  Lewandowski emerged from the executive office to find security waiting, and they watched him as he packed up his things, then escorted him out of the building, according to two sources briefed on the encounter.   He didn t put up a fight because he is loyal,  said one Lewandowski associate.   The gloves had come off a while ago, and Corey spent a lot of energy fighting, which took away from the campaign.   The source said Lewandowski  was surrounded by enemies.  He was outgunned.   Lewandowski declined to comment for this story.  He told CNN he was  proud to have been a small part  of Trump s campaign but didn t know why he was fired.   Things change as the campaign evolves,  he said, denying his dismissal had anything to do with tensions with Trump s family.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump stood by the decision.  He praised Lewandowski as  a good guy  and  a friend of mine  who  did a great job,  but he said  it s time now for a different kind of a campaign.  The Trump campaign would not say whether Trump was in the room for the firing.  It denied that Lewandowski s relationship with the candidate s family had anything to do with his termination, though the family members with whom sources say he clashed most   Trump s influential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner   did not respond to requests for comment.  The RNC also didn t respond to requests for comment. But interviews with about two dozen sources, including Trump family friends and people who work in and around the campaign, traced Lewandowski s firing to longstanding issues brought to the fore this month, as Trump struggled to pivot to a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton amid increasing campaign dysfunction and declining poll numbers.  The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, led to intensifying calls from influential Republicans   including Priebus   for Trump to moderate his inflammatory rhetoric, according to campaign sources.  They said that Lewandowski s critics   chief among them campaign chairman Paul Manafort   responded by arguing that Lewandowski was actually encouraging Trump s propensity to offend.  Priebus also told campaign officials that Lewandowski had become a significant impediment to ironing out tensions between the RNC and the campaign, according to two sources familiar with the interaction.  One said Priebus ticked off a number of areas in which Lewandowski  had been a roadblock.   The source said that Priebus' criticism  undercut and hurt the campaign,  which is more reliant on the national party for basic campaign infrastructure than that of any recent nominee. And Lewandowski s critics also pinned the blame on him for unflattering media coverage of Kushner s growing behind-the-scenes role in the campaign, according to three sources familiar with internal campaign dynamics.  This month, for instance, The Associated Press profiled Kushner, citing people inside the campaign griping about his inexperience and noting his father s convictions for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness intimidation. The perception inside Trump s inner circle was that  Corey was trying to isolate Trump and cut him off from even Ivanka and Jared,  said a longtime Trump business associate who speaks to the family and its representatives regularly.   That was overstepping his bounds.  Ivanka Trump, who for months had expressed misgivings about Lewandowski s temperament and qualifications for the job, last week grew increasingly resolute in her calls for his termination, according to several people in and around the campaign and the family.  One person close to the campaign said it got  to the point where she was going to distance herself from the campaign if Corey didn t go.  By early last week, erstwhile Trump adviser Roger Stone, a Manafort ally who had pushed for months for Lewandowski s ouster, was gleefully telling associates that a coup was imminent. In some ways, Lewandowski s story is the story of the Trump campaign. The scrappy 42-year-old from the hardscrabble mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, didn t have any presidential campaign experience when he was plucked from relative obscurity to run Trump s presidential campaign prior to its June 2015 launch.  At the time, the billionaire real estate showman was regarded by the political establishment as a sideshow with little chance of making an impact in the race, let alone winning the nomination. Lewandowski quickly built a strong rapport with Trump by treating him with absolute reverence, unfailingly referring to him as  Mr.  Trump  or  Sir    even when Trump wasn t around   and encouraging him to act on his bombastic instincts.  Lewandowski also reassured the sometimes tightfisted billionaire, who initially pledged to self-fund his campaign, that it wasn t necessary to invest serious money in the traditional tools of presidential campaigning, such as polling, voter files, analytics and major advertising campaigns.  Instead, Lewandowski s approach was to hire a tiny staff composed mostly of allies from his past jobs and to  let Trump be Trump.   The result was impressive: billions of dollars  worth of free publicity generated by Trump s confrontational rhetoric at splashy campaign rallies, during television interviews and on social media.  Initially, Trump s adult children were wary of Lewandowski s unwillingness to try to temper their father s rhetoric because they were concerned that it was damaging the family s brand and corporate partnerships, said the longtime Trump business associate.  But as Trump gained traction in the polls and began winning primaries, the Trump children realized that their father actually had a chance to win and questioned whether Lewandowski was  helping take their father to the next level, because he is not getting the type of advice he needs to temper his worst impulses,  said the associate.  But Trump stuck by Lewandowski, even after he was accused of roughing up a reporter in March, rejecting calls to fire him by explaining "I don't do that.  I'm loyal. "By the end of the month, though, Trump had brought on Manafort, a veteran of 40 years' worth of GOP presidential campaigns.  The move, which multiple sources said came at the behest of Trump s adult children, seemed a tacit acknowledgment of the limitations of Lewandowski s approach. Manafort brought in a cadre of associates from his days as a power lobbyist, dividing the campaign into two rival camps loyal to Manafort and Lewandowski.  The camps dispensed sometimes contradictory orders to campaign staff and provided conflicting advice to Trump.  Manafort urged more spending on advertising and hiring, while Lewandowski pushed back, vetoing at least two proposed Manafort hires. In an April meeting at Trump Tower, Trump deputized Manafort to reorganize the campaign and to take the reins, as first reported by POLITICO.  A top Lewandowski ally on the campaign named Stuart Jolly immediately tendered his resignation.  Lewandowski went home to his family in New Hampshire and privately told associates he intended to quit imminently as well, but Trump personally asked him to return, according to two campaign sources.  When he reappeared at Trump Tower, the infighting intensified to a degree unusual even in the alpha-dominated world of presidential politics, according to a handful of campaign insiders.  They describe a campaign in which the senior officials and their allies spent as much or more time waging internecine warfare as they did on campaign strategy. Manafort s allies circulated rumors about Lewandowski s personal life and had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a New York tabloid, according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to be.  Lewandowski s supporters, in turn, have urged Trump and his representatives to examine Manafort s personal life as well as the lobbying done by Manafort and his associates for controversial clients around the world, according to people on both sides of the Lewandowski-Manafort rift.  And according to two campaign sources, Lewandowski highlighted for Trump instances in which Manafort had been quoted telling ostensibly private audiences that the candidate intended to tone down his rhetoric in the general election.  Those reports deeply bothered Trump, who prided himself on rejecting political norms dictating that candidates speak from a script and avoid making provocative remarks. Manafort didn't respond to a request for comment. Late last month, Lewandowski successfully pushed Trump to fire one of Manafort s first major hires, political director Rick Wiley.  And he jealously guarded his access to the candidate, making sure that either he or an ally   usually communications director Hope Hicks   were at Trump s side at all times.  On plane rides, Lewandowski and Hicks would trade off Trump-watch duties, taking turns sitting next to him when one or the other needed to go to the bathroom, according to a source who witnessed the arrangement. But in recent days, Trump has increasingly seemed to come to grips with the need to expand his campaign and tone down his rhetoric, telling donors at a private fundraiser in Arizona on Saturday that he was preparing to pivot to the general election, according to a donor who was present.  Lewandowski accompanied Trump to the fundraiser, at the Goldwater House, where he was seen pacing back and forth with anxious energy, which is not at all unusual for the Red Bull-chugging operative.  In fact, the decision seems to have surprised Lewandowski and his allies in and around the campaign. One campaign official said that during a Sunday morning conversation about campaign strategy with Lewandowski, the erstwhile campaign manager gave no indication anything was amiss.  It was  a good chat,  the official said. Eli Stokols contributed to this report.  NEW YORK   Hundreds of top evangelical leaders walked into a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump here on Tuesday eager to get on board with the GOP nominee.  But as they left, many prominent figures indicated that Trump still hasn't sealed the deal. When eight leading Christian conservatives   including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Sealy Yates of Trump s evangelical advisory committee and Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B.  Anthony List   lined up for a news conference following a meeting with the candidate, not a single one was ready to fully endorse Trump and grant him access to their extensive networks of grass-roots activists. What they and other attendees offered instead was qualified encouragement for Trump, as many remarked that he had helped move them closer to an endorsement. That s a better take on Trump than many of the same leaders offered during the primary contests, but it still spells trouble.  At a stage of the campaign in which candidates are typically working to win over moderates and independents, the presumptive GOP nominee is still working to nail down support from one of his own party s core constituencies: Christian conservatives. On Tuesday, Trump made a full-throated appeal to religious Republicans.  Hundreds of evangelicals convened at a closed-door session at the cavernous Marriott Marquis in Times Square here for an all-day confab that featured appearances from various Trump representatives, including Ben Carson and Eric Trump, along with Trump himself. He used the meeting to paper over past differences with evangelicals, many of whom preferred Ted Cruz, Ben Carson or a host of other candidates over the eventual winner, as well as to highlight some areas of common ground, especially regarding his support for anti-abortion Supreme Court justices.  I ve been a Christian, and I love Christianity and the evangelicals have been so incredibly supportive,  Trump said in the private session, according to audio obtained by POLITICO.   Don t forget, when I ran, and all of a sudden I went to states that were highly evangelical, like as an example, South Carolina, and they said,  Well, Trump won t win this state because it s evangelical    not only did I win, I won in a landslide.   They really get me,  he continued, of evangelicals.   They understand.  And certainly, many of the die-hard conservatives here, who have no appetite for supporting Hillary Clinton, want a reason to get behind the GOP nominee.  By simply showing up, he moved closer to giving them one   but his work remains cut out for him.  I certainly liked what I saw today,  said Dr.  James Dobson, a veteran social conservative leader and previously vocal Trump critic. But despite being listed by the campaign as a member of Trump s evangelical advisory board, he said he wasn t yet prepared to endorse (endorsements weren t a requirement for joining the board).  It s early in the process, and there s plenty of time,  Dobson said, less than one month before the Republican National Convention commences.   But again, I m pleased by what I saw today.  That s about as far as I can go.  In an interview before the gathering, Perkins   a former Cruz backer   said he hoped to be able to eventually endorse Trump.   Because of the alternative, I would like to be at a point where I find that I can support him,  he said.   If I can support him, I think many other evangelical social conservatives can as well.  But it s going to be difficult because clearly there s a division right now in the evangelical ranks.  On Tuesday, Perkins said that the  conversation has begun today  and was complimentary of Trump, but said that he s still waiting to see whom Trump selects as a running mate, and how he reacts to a potentially very conservative platform at the RNC.  "Is he learning in this process? I think he is,  Perkins said.   Now it s important to see who he has around him.  In addition to giving the main address, Trump also met with about 50 of the country s most influential Christian conservative leaders, including Penny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America; Dannenfelser (who later said she would personally support backing Trump, but didn t know yet what the selection committee of her organization s political arm would do); and Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. , Nance said.  There, Trump railed against a culture of political correctness and stressed his support for defending religious liberty. There s more outreach to come.  Trump s campaign on Tuesday unveiled a list of more than two dozen Christian leaders who are members of his evangelical advisory board, including former Rep.  Michele Bachmann, Dobson, Falwell and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Trump needs those efforts to bear fruit.  Conservative Christians are an essential part of the GOP base, and turning them out is crucial for Republicans.  While Trump did win a significant slice of evangelical voters during the primary, as he noted to the group, many of the key leaders of the movement have stayed on the sidelines, depriving Trump of core activist support and sending a signal to other evangelicals that this election may be worth skipping, even as they remain steadfastly opposed to Clinton. The real estate mogul s past more-liberal record on social issues is still of significant concern, as is his history of antagonizing various minority groups, including prisoners of war and people with disabilities.  The awkward fit was on full display Tuesday when Trump posed for a photo with the Falwells.  In tweeting the photo, Falwell Jr.  said he was excited to be introducing Trump, but many pointed out that the trio was posing in front of a framed cover of Playboy magazine. Tuesday s events more broadly were aimed at strengthening the ties between Trump and the constituency he hopes to energize. Both the format and the moderator were sympathetic to that aim.  Former Arkansas Gov.  Mike Huckabee struck a reassuring and solicitous tone as he moderated the event.  Attendees weren t looking to elect a pastor, he told Trump, who last summer said he has never asked God for forgiveness.  There was no opportunity for follow-up questions or further probing on issues. Only a handful of questions   about Israel, religious liberty and immigration   were taken, and some attendees were disappointed that time ran out before Trump could be asked about abortion, an issue on which he s switched positions several times.  There s some things I d like to talk to him about, to hear a little more from him on the specific issue of Planned Parenthood,  Nance said.   But he really didn t hurt himself today.  He did, however, stress his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, saying that a conservative court would go a long way toward protecting anti-abortion measures, religious liberty and gun rights.  Trump repeatedly painted the election as a choice between his conservative court picks and Hillary Clinton s more reliably liberal ones.                             Clergy leaders demonstrate on June 21 in New York where Donald Trump is scheduled to meet evangelical clergy.     These will be Supreme Court justices that will be intellects, that will be talented men in what they do   and women   and also be pro-life,  he said, noting that in addition to the list of possible Supreme Court justices he has already released, he might have four or five names to add to the list down the road.  This next president   could have five justices in the Supreme Court,  he said.   Probably three, very possibly four, it could even be five.  If Hillary Clinton gets in, we know what she s going to put in there, we know what s going to happen.    We re going to end up being Venezuela, if she gets in, for a lot of different reasons.  Ultimately, the attendees  opposition to Clinton may be Trump s best hope for pulling their enthusiastic support, and he played to that anger Tuesday when he questioned Clinton s faith and suggested she would be problematic for religious Christians. But Reed, of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said that Trump gave attendees reason to be actively excited about him as well.  I think he had a good day,  he told reporters from POLITICO and National Review, going on to add,  He showed up.  He came to a meeting of over a thousand Christian leaders and spent hours hearing their concerns, receiving their wisdom and their counsel, and answering their questions.  And the second thing is, he made it very clear on matters of life, religious freedom, support for Israel, he stands with them.  Trump also suggested that he believes Christianity is under attack, a view shared by many in the room.  I ve talked about a temporary ban on Muslims, until we find out what s going on,  he said.   I was met with   everything.  Some people thought, great, some people didn t think so great.  If I said something about Christianity, it would be a whole different ballgame.  We can t let that happen, folks.  After Trump effectively clinched the nomination in May, many evangelical leaders grappled both with whether to endorse him, and, if they reached that point, whether to activate their extensive grass-roots networks on his behalf.  It was a question several top leaders in attendance were still pondering Tuesday as they left.  The choice isn t between supporting him and Hillary,  Nance said.   It s between supporting him, turning out the people they influence, or doing nothing.  She remains undecided as to her next step, as does Perkins. For Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative activist, it s an easier call.  Bauer, who was supporting Cruz, said he had to decided both to back Trump and to use his political organization to assist the presumptive GOP nominee.  He is planning a more formal endorsement in the coming weeks.  Look, it s a binary decision,  he said, going on to add.   We ll definitely be promoting the ideas that we agree with that he s standing for.  Outside the Marriott, a lone figure in a blue suit stood waging his own personal protest. Eric Teetsel, a Christian activist who ran religious outreach for Marco Rubio, stood by himself with a sign.   Torture is not pro-life,  his sign read.   Racism is not pro-life.  Misogyny is not pro-life.  Murdering the children of terrorists is not pro-life.   I may be standing here by myself, but I know I m not alone,  Teetsel said, going on to add,  There are millions of Christians who look at the candidates in this race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and say,  I can t vote for either of them in good conscience.   And they are wondering what to do.                   Donald Trump speaks at the Saint Andelm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire June 13.   Did he say anything? I had been interviewing a source, and I couldn t take my cellphone out of my pocket every time it buzzed.  So for 20 minutes, I was cut off from the outside world, I was cut off from him.  I was cut off from my Trump fix.  No Twitter.  No texts.  No websites.  No cable TV.  My palms were sweaty.  My heart was pounding.  Anything could have happened.  So I fired up my iPhone and checked Twitter.  The New York Times had the scoop:  Donald Trump Parts Ways With Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager.   Then there was this attack-tweet from Hillary Clinton s chief strategist Joel Benenson:  Polls drop.  Trump dumps mgr.  S.  Beckett:  There s man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet.    S.  Beckett refers to Samuel Beckett, an Irish playwright and Nobel Prize winner, who is currently dead.  The quotation came from Beckett s play  Waiting for Godot,  which debuted in 1953.  In it, people sit around and talk and talk while accomplishing virtually nothing.  The play is, in other words, a metaphor for modern presidential campaigning.  The Trump campaign officially tweeted:  The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.   This is standard pol-speak for:  Don t let the door hit you in the butt on your way out and if you try to steal any Sharpies, you will be arrested and beaten.   The Politico story quoted a senior Trump aide as saying that  Lewandowski was not getting along with the Republican National Committee, that there was a recognition that the campaign was falling behind Hillary Clinton from an infrastructure perspective and that there was recognition that Lewandowski was no longer up to the job.   In addition, there must have been a heck of a lot of Sharpies missing.  The story dominated cable, with CNN reporting that Ivanka Trump, Donald s oldest daughter, had a one-on-one meeting with her father over the weekend and demanded that Lewandowski be dumped.  Given the choice of picking a new campaign manager or picking a new oldest daughter, Trump went with Ivanka.  But getting rid of Lewandowski did serve one positive purpose.  It changed the Trump  story of the day    there always has to be at least one   away from a speech in which Trump had said:  Belgium is a beautiful city.   It is not.  And I don t need some Irish Nobel Prize winner to tell me that.  All I need is a map of Europe.  Belgium is a country.  Brussels, its capital, is a city.  Both begin with the letter  b,  which is why Trump ran into trouble.  He majored in screwing other people on bad deals, not geography.  So dumping Lewandowski, embarrassing as it was, gave the media something else to write about.  Like how embarrassing Trump s running mate is going to be.  Take Newt Gingrich.  Please.  Rick Tyler, a former Ted Cruz spokesman who was fired in February for posting fake tweets and Facebook entries about Marco Rubio   are you following all this?   said recently:  I don t know two other people who can command more media attention than Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump.  Keeping your enemies constantly on defense, constantly off balance, constantly explaining themselves.  Newt knows how to do that.   Newt also knows how to make news.  Like when he advocated building a permanent base on the moon by the end of his second presidential term and using the base for manned flights to Mars.  This is exactly the kind of vice president Trump needs.  It lets him say,  I might be nuts, but Newt is bat-poo crazy.  So don t even dream of impeaching me.   What Hillary needs to learn from all this is how to go on the offense against Trump.  She has to be proactive instead of reactive.  She has to make people say,  Did she say anything? Did I miss anything Hillary said?  And there are signs she is beginning to get it.  A few weeks ago, Hillary jumped all over Trump.   Donald Trump s ideas aren t just different   they are dangerously incoherent,  Clinton said.   They re not really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.   Trump reacted with typical aplomb: which is to say, he went into a series of bizarre rants.   I have a strong temperament, and it s a very good temperament and it s a very in control temperament or I wouldn t have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn t have built all of the things that I ve been able to do in life!  he spluttered.   I mean, No.  1 best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success.    Uh, television,  The Apprentice,  which is, forget it.  I mean NBC came to me.  They wanted to renew so badly, you have no idea.   Yes, we have no idea.  On Wednesday, Trump will fly to Scotland and then to Ireland to show off his golf courses there.  He is scheduled to return to America on Saturday.  Which leaves us with one big question: Should we let him back in? Roger Simon is POLITICO's chief political columnist.

PHOENIX   Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a  Happy Birthday  message.  Did he get in touch?  the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied,  no,  but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email.  A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite "I love Sheriff Joe!"It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14   but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens. Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate.  They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny  political correctness  of minority groups.  Arpaio hit on the formula first   adding a Korean War veteran s fondness for accumulating . 50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance   but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick.   I don t like people to say,  He s copying you,   Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast. As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does   but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence. During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others? Why would I bite the hand that feeds?  he said, shaking his head in disapproval. In Arpaio s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him.   I'm controversial,  he added with a shrug.   You wouldn't be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I don't think.  (In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed   he had the medical bills.  In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3. 75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriff's real estate transactions. )(Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York s tabloids.  Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being  controversial  was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation.  Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he s  strictly a self-made madman.  He s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news.  He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn t so bad ( there wasn't that much crime when the mob   now, I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too.  . . .  They will never kill a child or a cop, OK? ). He knew I was Jewish, so I got this:  Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security.  I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people.  I'm not just saying that because you're Jewish.  Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point.   The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky,  he added.   I don't know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money.  Actually, I'm the only one that ever busted that guy.  Do you know that?  (I did not. )Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus.  When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea   thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter   that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy. "Whether it s gays, ISIS   there s one other thing} that nobody is talking about.  Everybody there happened to be Latino.  Why?   because that was a night for Latino and Cuban,  he told me.   Why didn t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn t like it? Come on.  You re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS.  What about Hispanics? Why isn t anybody   why hasn t the news media even asked that question? Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded.  He was undeterred.  It could be because there is talk around the nation   there s a lot of people that don t like Hispanics.  Is that a secret?  he added. In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics. Oh, and he used county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama s  fake  birth certificate.  (An Arpaio-allied group later tried to reimburse the county for the expense but was rebuffed by the board of supervisors. ) That s what got him his first give- em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump.   That s not dead as far as I m concerned,  he told me. But beneath the bombast, there s a whisper of a showman s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump.  It s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician s power is ultimately derived from the news media   and when they turn on you, look out.  I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.   You could care less about me, and I should be dead and buried because there s not one media that will come and remember who Joe Arpaio is.  That s the way it is in politics.  Joe Arpaio is literally a poor man s Donald Trump   same approach, different bank account and in Arpaio s life story he s the poor (or at last the working-class) man.  His birthday is a bittersweet occasion, even without Trump s partial snub.  On June 14, 1932, Arpaio s mother, a 28-year-old immigrant from a town just south of Naples, died giving birth to him.  His old man, who had immigrated (legally, through Ellis Island, Arpaio says) in the 1920s, struggled to run a small grocery store.  And the two Arpaios shuffled through a succession of Italian family-run boarding houses in western Massachusetts, sharing a bedroom, a bath and two plates at someone else s dinner table until his father remarried.  Eighty-four times   you have to look back at your life,  he said, subdued on his birthday amid the defiant detritus of his career   the New York Post front pages lauding the tent city, a poster of him hugging the  Trumpinator  at a March rally in his suburban Phoenix neighborhood.   I never had a mother to grow up with, but that s the way it is.  . . .  It was a little difficult sometimes when you don t have a mother and you're bounced from one Italian family to another.  Twenty years before Trump pulled off the biggest outsider coup in the history of the Republican Party, Arpaio was tapping that same, deep vein of post-Reagan distrust, loss and anger among working- and middle-class whites.  Maricopa, with its 4 million people, is one of the biggest and fastest-growing counties in the country   a sprawl of predominantly Republican suburban subdivisions emanating from the Democratic-dominated city of Phoenix, with lots of disaffected ethnic northern emigrants like himself. The county is about 78 percent white, but about a third of households identify as Latino   a recipe for long-term tensions and polarized politics.  In the early 1990s, at the height of the crack epidemic and crime wave, the county was ripe territory for a candidate running on what, in retrospect, amounted to a  Make Maricopa Great Again  campaign.  Arpaio captured big majorities (in the five elections between 1992 and 2008, he netted from 55 percent to 66 percent) with a hard-edged, law-and-order message that made Rudy Giuliani look like an ACLU lawyer. Arpaio, even his enemies concede, is an engaging guy with an intuitive sense of seizing the moment   and he thinks Trump, responding to a stagnant economy and a widespread sense that the immigration problem is out of control   has the same knack.   Timing is perfect right now for a guy like him,  he told me.   Timing is everything, and he hit on the right timing.  But times are changing, and the realities that are bedeviling Trump nationally began buffeting Arpaio locally in 2012, when he finished with barely half the vote in a crowded field.  He s running again this year and blames the Obama administration s campaign against his policies for the drop.  But local analysts noted a telling shift   support had slipped among educated whites who had previously backed him but were now turned off by his stridency and age. Arpaio was an enthusiastic enforcer of Arizona s now-voided 2010 immigration law, and he ran afoul of a federal judge in 2013 after telling a group of supporters he d locked up 500 suspected illegal immigrant drivers his deputies had pulled over  out of spite.   He flat-out refused to talk about that case or the Obama administration s racial profiling case   he not only dismissed the idea that his department acted prejudicially, but also cast doubt that anti-black or anti-Latino discrimination exists at all in 2016 America.  I think it's overstated,  he said.   I think there's a lot of hype.  Unfortunately, in our country today, you have to be very careful what you say.  We do have freedom of speech, but if you say the wrong word, it looks like it makes headlines.  So everybody has to be very careful.   You don't think that there is systematic discrimination in this country against Latinos and blacks at this point?  I asked. His answer:  No.  No.  No, I really don t.  When I pointed out that many critics had called him  a racist,  he waved dismissively.  When they can't get you for anything else, it's a famous word,  racist,   he said.   Do you think it bothers me? It doesn't really bother me.  I know in my heart what I am, so they can call me anything they want.  . . .  I m probably one guy that really doesn t discriminate, you know, and I m not going to say my best friend is black.  . . .  No, no, no.  And even in my family, I have a black and I have Mexican.  I got all these family   but I m not going to say that.  I guess you could still have that and say you re a racist, you know, but no.  I know what I am.  Come on.  He really likes Trump, gave him a souvenir or two ( he s got my underwear ) was touched when the developer reached out to comfort his ailing wife, and buys his candidate s claim of a  silent majority  that will pop up in November to confound the pundits and the pollsters. Still, even Arpaio recognizes the political perils of being associated with the presumptive Republican nominee.  All these politicians afraid to go near him,  he said, adding that Trump and his staff have never told him what to say, nor chided him for speaking his mind, as if they could.  I think everybody is looking at their own elections.  I hate to say that,  Arpaio added.   You know it; I know it.  You want me to say it, and I'm saying it.  . . .  People have to worry about their own future, their own elections.  I understand that.  But I'm not the type of guy that does that.  I don't throw people under the bus.  I know there s a lot of controversy on the Hispanic vote.  People are always saying,  Oh, you can t win if you don't have the Hispanic vote.   He pauses to adjust the glasses and reflects for the briefest of moments on his own political twilight, and a potentially tough 2016 reelection campaign.  If there's anybody that should be shying away from Trump, it s me, with all the heat I m taking, right?  he said.   Any smart guy would do that, but I m not a smart guy, maybe.   PHOENIX   Joe Arpaio was standing in his top-floor office looking down on a summer cityscape baked semolina-loaf brown waiting for Donald Trump to call, or even email, a  Happy Birthday  message.  Did he get in touch?  the 84-year-old Maricopa County sheriff asked his assistant, who replied,  no,  but a Trump aide had sent a really sweet email.  A few days later, at a rally in the city in a 109-degree Saturday, Arpaio introduced a mellower-than-usual Trump who, in turn, delivered his requisite "I love Sheriff Joe!"It is cosmic coincidence that the fiery Arpaio, the stocky Italian populist prototype for the burlier Scotch-German GOP nominee, was born on the very same day, June 14   but 14 years earlier, two states away in Massachusetts, and far poorer than silver-spooned baby Donald in Queens. Sheriff Joe endorsed Trump early and describes him as his one true political soulmate.  They share a boot-on-throat rhetorical style, a focus on kicking out illegal immigrants and kicking the ass of America s enemies, and both love bashing the whiny  political correctness  of minority groups.  Arpaio hit on the formula first   adding a Korean War veteran s fondness for accumulating . 50-caliber machine guns and other military ordnance   but he is too media-smart to walk into the trap I set by suggesting Trump is stealing his shtick.   I don t like people to say,  He s copying you,   Arpaio said during an hourlong interview for POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast. As a rule, Arpaio is loath to criticize anything Trump says or does   but he did allow himself one point of significant divergence. During his 23 years as sheriff, did he ever ban a news outlet from his events and press conferences, as Trump has done with POLITICO, The Washington Post and others? Why would I bite the hand that feeds?  he said, shaking his head in disapproval. In Arpaio s view, controversy is a useful tool, a way of elevating the causes he cares about (guns, law and order, immigration, the epidemic of wimp-ism), but it s also not just a means but an end, the only way to grab the attention of a national media and political establishment that would otherwise ignore him.   I'm controversial,  he added with a shrug.   You wouldn't be here talking to me if I was a nothing, I don't think.  (In reality, Arpaio not only bit the hand that fed   he had the medical bills.  In 2013, the county board of supervisors paid $3. 75 million to a pair of New Times editors who said they were falsely imprisoned after writing about the sheriff's real estate transactions. )(Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush)Trump was born with a famous name, a fortune and direct access to New York s tabloids.  Arpaio had none of these advantages and he talks freely about how being  controversial  was the best way for an outsider like him to break into the national conversation.  Put another way, in the half-joking words of a longtime Arizona critic, he s  strictly a self-made madman.  He s easier to detest at a distance than up close, and there s a Rat Pack madcap to his patter that gets lost in the sound-bite outrage culture of cable news.  He was a cop in Vegas in the 1960s, when the Mafia ran everything, he s fond of saying, and you know, it wasn t so bad ( there wasn't that much crime when the mob   now, I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the mob had its own ethics too.  . . .  They will never kill a child or a cop, OK? ). He knew I was Jewish, so I got this:  Israel is a great country for examples on how to do security.  I really love how Israel operates, and I love the Jewish people.  I'm not just saying that because you're Jewish.  Then, instantly, he linked the Vegas point with the Israel point to make a whole new point.   The only Jewish guy that the mob hired is Meyer Lansky,  he added.   I don't know how he sneaked in there, but he knew how to count the money.  Actually, I'm the only one that ever busted that guy.  Do you know that?  (I did not. )Conspiracy theories sprout from him like needles from a cactus.  When it came to the Orlando attacks, Arpaio pushed the idea   thus far alien to law enforcement officials probing the muddled motives of the shooter   that Omar Mateen may have gunned down 49 people in an anti-Latino frenzy. "Whether it s gays, ISIS   there s one other thing} that nobody is talking about.  Everybody there happened to be Latino.  Why?   because that was a night for Latino and Cuban,  he told me.   Why didn t anybody ever think, does this guy have it in for Hispanics? Why doesn t anybody think of that? I mean, is it possible he didn t like it? Come on.  You re saying it may be gay, maybe the ISIS.  What about Hispanics? Why isn t anybody   why hasn t the news media even asked that question? Because local cops and the FBI have never said that might be the case, I responded.  He was undeterred.  It could be because there is talk around the nation   there s a lot of people that don t like Hispanics.  Is that a secret?  he added. In the early 1990s, Arpaio parlayed a successful but relatively low-key federal law enforcement career into fame (and infamy): Arpaio is the guy who slapped those pink undies on inmates in front of the national TV crews (he hands out autographed bloomers to visitors from a storage nook behind his desk), houses prisoners in a hotter-than-Hades tent city and feeds them crappy high-calorie meals, and remains the subject of an Obama Justice Department suit alleging his department systematically discriminated against Hispanics. Oh, and he used county resources to fruitlessly pursue Barack Obama s  fake  birth certificate.  (An Arpaio-allied group later tried to reimburse the county for the expense but was rebuffed by the board of supervisors. ) That s what got him his first give- em-hell letter from part-time birther Trump.   That s not dead as far as I m concerned,  he told me. But beneath the bombast, there s a whisper of a showman s self-awareness in Arpaio that seems so absent in Trump.  It s a bad idea, he tells me, to alienate reporters and news organizations, even when they are out to get you, because a politician s power is ultimately derived from the news media   and when they turn on you, look out.  I ll tell you, the day I leave, you won t know how to pronounce my name,  he said, sitting at a conference table under a mounted billy club and blackjack.
